# Iteration 1: Grande Table — Transcript

## Round 1: What is battery recycling, fundamentally? Where does the value come from, and what are the real constraints?

**Kenji Tanaka:** Let me ground this conversation before it drifts into aspiration. A lithium-ion battery cathode — take NMC 811, which is the industry direction — is lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt in an 8:0.5:0.5 molar ratio, locked into a layered oxide crystal structure. The anode is graphite with lithium intercalated during charging. The electrolyte is a lithium salt in organic solvents. Now, to "recycle" this, you have to reverse the mixing. You have to take intimately mixed metals out of a crystal lattice, separate them, and produce battery-grade pure salts. The Gibbs free energy of mixing is negative — meaning nature favored the mixed state. To unmix, you pay the energy back, plus the inefficiency of your process. This is not pessimism. This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Every recycling process — pyro, hydro, direct — is just a different way of paying this entropy tax. Pyrometallurgy pays it thermally at 1200-1600°C, destroying the crystal structure entirely. Hydrometallurgy pays it chemically with acid dissolution and selective precipitation. Direct recycling tries to minimize the payment by preserving the crystal structure and just relithiating. Each has trade-offs. None escapes the fundamental constraint. When I hear someone say "battery recycling will be profitable," my first question is: at what metal prices? Because the thermodynamic cost is fixed, but the revenue depends on commodity markets that you don't control.

**Wei Zhang:** Kenji is correct on the physics and wrong on the conclusion. Yes, there's a thermodynamic floor. But the distance between that floor and where current processes operate is enormous — and that gap is where engineering lives. At Brunp, we reduced our energy consumption per tonne of processed material by 35% over four years through process optimization — not through any thermodynamic breakthrough, but through better heat recovery, more selective reagents, and eliminating unnecessary process steps. Kenji's analysis treats the current process as the thermodynamic minimum. It's not even close. More importantly, Kenji's framing misses what I consider the central insight: the most expensive step in recycling is not the chemistry — it's the logistics and the mismatch between what goes in and what needs to come out. At Brunp, 40% of our input is manufacturing scrap from CATL's own production. This material has known composition, arrives from 2 kilometers away, and requires minimal preprocessing. Our effective processing cost for this stream is 60% lower than for end-of-life batteries. The real question is not "what does thermodynamics permit?" but "how do you structure the business so that the input stream is as close to the output specification as possible?"

**Marcus Holloway:** Wei just said the quiet part out loud, and I want to make sure everyone heard it. Forty percent of Brunp's input is manufacturing scrap. Not end-of-life batteries. Not the EV packs that all the breathless recycling projections are built on. Production waste. This is the dirty secret of the entire battery recycling industry right now: most of what gets "recycled" is manufacturing scrap that never made it into a product. The economics of recycling manufacturing scrap are good because the material is clean, the composition is known, and the logistics are trivial. The economics of recycling a 10-year-old EV battery pack that's been through a car crash, has degraded electrolyte, unknown state of health, and needs to be discharged, disassembled, and sorted — those economics are completely different. I've operated both streams. Manufacturing scrap is a profitable business. End-of-life EV batteries are a cost center that you hope to make less negative over time. The entire industry's projections are built on extrapolating manufacturing scrap economics to end-of-life volumes. That's a category error.

**Adele Fontaine:** Marcus is right about the feedstock distinction, but his conclusion — that end-of-life economics are permanently broken — reflects operational cynicism, not analytical rigor. Let me explain why. The challenge of end-of-life batteries is feedstock variability: mixed chemistries, contaminants, degraded materials. In nuclear reprocessing, we solved an analogous problem decades ago. Spent nuclear fuel is a far more complex mixture than spent battery black mass — it contains over 200 different fission products, actinides in multiple oxidation states, and activation products, all in a ceramic matrix that must be dissolved in hot nitric acid. We achieve 99.8% uranium recovery and 99.5% plutonium recovery from this mess, at industrial scale, year after year. The key is rigorous feedstock characterization and process flexibility — adjusting reagent concentrations, extraction conditions, and separation sequences to the specific batch composition. The battery recycling industry doesn't do this because it inherited its processes from mining, where the ore composition is relatively constant. When you treat every batch of black mass the same way, of course your yields are inconsistent and your economics are fragile. The solution is process discipline, not resignation.

**Socrate:** Adele, you've drawn an analogy between nuclear reprocessing and battery recycling. Under what conditions does this analogy break down? Specifically: nuclear reprocessing is funded by governments with effectively unlimited budgets for strategic reasons. Battery recycling must survive on commodity margins. Does the analogy hold when the economic constraints are this different?

**Adele Fontaine:** The analogy holds on the chemistry and process engineering — the separation science is transferable. It doesn't hold on the economics, I'll grant that. La Hague's operating costs are absorbed by EDF and the French state because nuclear sovereignty is a strategic priority. Battery recycling has no such patron... yet. But I'd argue the EU Battery Regulation is creating exactly that kind of strategic mandate. When you require 16% recycled cobalt content by 2031, you've created a guaranteed market for recycled material independent of commodity prices. That's not as generous as a state nuclear budget, but it's a floor.

**Clara Mwangi:** I want to redirect this conversation from chemistry to geography, because everyone here is debating process efficiency as if the recycling plant is the only thing that matters. It's not. Let me give you a number: the average collection cost for an end-of-life EV battery in the United States is $800-1,200 per pack. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where informal collection networks handle lead-acid batteries with extraordinary efficiency, the collection cost is $50-200 per battery. Why? Because the informal sector has solved the logistics problem through economic incentives — collectors earn a living from it. Now here's the problem nobody in this room wants to talk about: where will the batteries be in 2035? Not where are they now — where will they be? China will have 40% of the world's end-of-life EV batteries. Europe 25%. The US 15%. Southeast Asia and the Global South, combined, maybe 15%. But that 15% will be the hardest to collect, the most dangerous if improperly handled, and the most likely to end up in informal processing — which for lithium-ion means fires, toxic fumes, and environmental contamination. Every model I've seen for battery recycling assumes the batteries come to you. Nobody is modeling the reverse logistics at scale, and certainly nobody is planning for the 100 million batteries that will reach end-of-life in countries without formal recycling infrastructure.

**Nikolai Petrov:** Clara raises the logistics question, which I want to connect to the economic question that Kenji and Marcus have been framing. Both of them compare recycling costs to virgin material costs and find recycling wanting. But they're comparing against a fiction. Virgin lithium at $5,000/tonne from the Atacama? That price externalizes the aquifer depletion that's destroying Atacameño communities' water supply. The Chilean government's new lithium royalties will add $800-1,200/tonne. Carbon pricing at EU ETS rates adds another $200-400. Geopolitical risk premium — what happens when one country restricts exports, as China has done for graphite and germanium — adds 10-15%. When I build a full-cost model, virgin lithium isn't $5,000/tonne. It's $8,500-10,000. And it's going up, because the easy deposits are being depleted and the environmental and political costs of mining are being internalized. Recycled lithium's costs are going down with scale and learning. The crossover isn't in 2040. It's in 2028-2030 for some chemistries and geographies.

**Kenji Tanaka:** Nikolai, I respect your externality analysis, but I need to push back on one specific claim. You say "recycled lithium's costs are going down." Down from where, and by how much? The thermodynamic minimum for lithium recovery from NMC black mass via hydrometallurgy is approximately 15-20 kWh per kg of lithium carbonate recovered. Current best processes use 50-80 kWh/kg. That's a 3-4x gap that process optimization can narrow. But even at the thermodynamic minimum, you're looking at $1,500-2,500/tonne in energy costs alone, before reagents, labor, capital amortization, and waste treatment. Add those and the floor is $3,500-5,000/tonne. Your virgin lithium at $8,500-10,000 makes recycling look viable. But if brine lithium is $5,000 and hard-rock is $7,000 — which is where they are today without your externality adjustments — the margin is thin to negative. The question is: do your externalities get priced in by markets, or only by regulation? Because if it's only regulation, you're building an industry on political will, and political will is volatile.

**Socrate:** The assembly seems to be converging on a view that battery recycling economics depend heavily on external factors — commodity prices, regulation, externality pricing — rather than on the intrinsic value proposition of the recycling process itself. Is this actually true? Is there any scenario in which battery recycling is intrinsically profitable — meaning profitable without subsidies, mandates, or externality pricing — on the basis of the recovered material value alone?

**Marcus Holloway:** I can answer that directly. Yes — for high-cobalt chemistries processed as manufacturing scrap in a vertically integrated operation. NMC 111 or NMC 532 scrap, known composition, processed into precursor hydroxide and fed back into cathode production. Brunp does this profitably. Some of Umicore's operations do this profitably. But that's a shrinking market. The industry is moving to NMC 811 (less cobalt), to LFP (no cobalt, no nickel), and to sodium-ion (no lithium). Each chemistry shift makes the intrinsic economics worse. For LFP end-of-life batteries — which will be the dominant waste stream by 2035 — I don't see a path to intrinsic profitability. The recoverable lithium value is $3,000-3,500 per tonne of cells. The processing cost is $2,000-4,000. The collection and disassembly cost is another $1,000-2,000. You're underwater before you start. LFP recycling will happen because of regulation, not because of economics.

**Wei Zhang:** Marcus is right on the per-unit economics and wrong on the conclusion. LFP recycling at Brunp is profitable. How? Because we don't sell lithium carbonate on the commodity market. We feed recycled lithium directly into our own LFP cathode production line. The value isn't the commodity price of lithium — it's the avoided cost of purchasing lithium plus the avoided logistics of sourcing it from the Atacama or Australia. When your recycling plant and your cathode plant are in the same industrial park, the transport cost is zero, the quality control is integrated, and you've eliminated three middlemen. Standalone recyclers lose money on LFP because they're selling into a commodity market. Integrated producers make money on LFP because they're substituting an internal input. This is the fundamental structural difference that Marcus keeps missing because he thinks in merchant market terms.

**Clara Mwangi:** Wei, your model works for CATL because CATL is the world's largest battery manufacturer with enormous captive demand for recycled material. What about the other 95% of the world that doesn't have a CATL? What about Vietnam, where Vinfast is building an EV industry? What about India, where Ola Electric is scaling? What about Brazil, where lithium is mined but no batteries are manufactured? Your vertical integration model is a solution for China and maybe for the 3-4 Western companies large enough to replicate it. It's not a solution for the global recycling challenge.

## Round 2: Where are the real opportunities and what's actually undervalued?

**Nikolai Petrov:** I want to redirect to opportunities, because this assembly keeps gravitating toward what's hard. Let me name what I think is the single most undervalued opportunity in battery recycling: graphite. Synthetic graphite for battery anodes costs $8,000-15,000 per tonne. Over 90% of it is produced in China. Recovering graphite from spent batteries is technically straightforward — it's already in the right form, it just needs purification. Yet almost nobody recovers it. Pyrometallurgy burns it. Most hydrometallurgical processes treat it as waste. A few startups — Altilium, Cyclic Materials — are working on it, but the field is wide open. The economics are compelling: $8,000-15,000/tonne product value, $1,000-2,000/tonne processing cost, and a massive supply security argument because China controls the supply. If I were an engineer looking for an adjacent opportunity in battery recycling, I'd be looking at graphite recovery and purification. It's the rare case where the economics close today, without subsidies, if you can get the quality right.

**Adele Fontaine:** Nikolai is correct about graphite, and I'll add another adjacent opportunity: electrolyte recovery. Current recycling processes either burn the electrolyte (pyro) or wash it away (hydro). But lithium hexafluorophosphate — the standard electrolyte salt — is worth $15,000-25,000 per tonne, and the organic solvents (ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate) are worth $2,000-4,000. A selective electrolyte recovery step before cathode processing could capture significant value. The challenge is that electrolyte degrades during battery operation — thermal decomposition, SEI formation — so the recovered material needs reconditioning. But the separation chemistry is relatively simple: vacuum distillation for the solvents, selective precipitation for the salt. This is undergraduate chemistry. Nobody does it because the recycling industry inherited its process design from end-of-pipe waste treatment, where electrolyte is a contaminant to be removed. If you redesign the process with electrolyte as a valuable output, the economics shift.

**Wei Zhang:** I want to name a different kind of opportunity: the data and traceability layer. The EU Battery Regulation requires a battery passport by 2027 — a digital record of every battery's composition, manufacturing history, state of health, and chain of custody. This creates an entirely new business: battery lifecycle data management. Whoever builds the infrastructure for tracking batteries from manufacture through use to end-of-life controls the information that makes recycling efficient. Today, a recycler receives a pallet of batteries and has no idea what's in them — what chemistry, what state of charge, what degradation state. That uncertainty adds cost at every step. A battery passport system eliminates that uncertainty. The company that builds the trusted data layer for the battery industry will capture enormous value, and it's a software and standards play, not a chemistry play. For an engineer, this might be more interesting than recycling itself.

**Marcus Holloway:** Wei's right about the data opportunity, and I'll extend it. The most valuable near-term business in the battery recycling ecosystem isn't recycling — it's sorting and testing. When an EV battery reaches "end of life" at 70-80% capacity, it's not waste. It still has 5-10 years of useful life as stationary storage. A pack that's worth $1,000-2,000 as scrap metal is worth $5,000-8,000 as a refurbished energy storage system. But you need to test it, grade it, and match it to the right second-life application. That's a testing, grading, and remarketing business — much higher margin than breaking it down for metals. Companies like Connected Energy, Betteries, ReJoule are in this space. It's Clara's reuse-before-recycle hierarchy, and the economics are better. The real recycling wave — processing batteries that are truly dead — doesn't arrive in volume until 2032-2035 for EVs. Until then, the money is in second life.

**Socrate:** Marcus, you've just argued that second-life applications are more economically attractive than recycling. But doesn't second life merely delay recycling by 5-10 years? And when those second-life batteries finally die, won't they be even harder to recycle — more degraded, potentially in distributed stationary storage installations across many locations rather than concentrated in auto dealerships? Are you solving the economics problem or just deferring it?

**Marcus Holloway:** Deferring, mostly. But deferring is underrated. In five years, recycling technology will be more mature, collection infrastructure will be better, and regulatory frameworks will be established. Recycling a 2025 battery in 2035 will be cheaper than recycling it in 2025. The time value matters. And second life generates economic activity and value in the interim. The batteries do useful work — they store solar power, they provide grid services. That's not waste; that's extending the productive life of an asset. Yes, collection from distributed stationary storage will be harder than from auto dealers. But by then we'll have battery passports tracking their location, and the reverse logistics will be someone else's problem to solve.

**Kenji Tanaka:** I want to name what I think is genuinely undervalued and connects back to my thermodynamic framework: process intensification. Not new chemistry — better engineering of existing chemistry. Microreactors, membrane separations, electrochemical refining. These are technologies that reduce the gap between current practice and the thermodynamic minimum. Current hydrometallurgical recycling uses batch processes designed in the 1970s. Continuous-flow microreactor technology can achieve faster reaction kinetics, better heat transfer, smaller footprint, and lower reagent consumption. The battery recycling industry hasn't adopted these because it's a young industry importing old mining techniques. An engineer with process intensification expertise could make a significant impact — not by inventing new chemistry but by making existing chemistry run closer to its theoretical efficiency.

**Clara Mwangi:** Everyone here is naming opportunities in the technical stack. Let me name the opportunity nobody wants to discuss: the governance gap. There is no international framework for transboundary movement of spent lithium-ion batteries equivalent to the Basel Convention amendments for hazardous waste. The EU, US, China, and Japan each have different classification and handling requirements. This means that right now, the most efficient economic outcome — shipping batteries from where they're used to where recycling capacity exists — is legally and logistically nightmarish. Whoever builds the regulatory intelligence and compliance infrastructure for transboundary battery waste movement will have a monopoly position. It's not sexy, but regulatory arbitrage and compliance in waste movement is where several billion-dollar companies were built in the broader waste industry. The battery equivalent doesn't exist yet.

**Nikolai Petrov:** Clara's point connects to what I consider the biggest unanswered strategic question in this space: who will control the recycled material supply chain? Right now, China dominates primary refining. If China also dominates recycling — which it's on track to do, with Brunp, GEM, and Huayou processing most of the world's battery waste — then the strategic vulnerability that motivated Western governments to invest in recycling remains. The EU and US are subsidizing domestic recycling capacity to break dependence on China. But the subsidies expire. The regulations can change. Will the Western recycling industry be competitive without policy support? Or will Chinese recyclers, with their integrated cost advantages that Wei described, simply outcompete once the subsidies end? This is the $50 billion question, and I don't think anyone has a confident answer.

## Round 3: What are the big debates and unanswered questions?

**Adele Fontaine:** Let me name what I consider the most important unresolved technical debate: hydrometallurgy vs. direct recycling. Hydrometallurgy dissolves everything and rebuilds from scratch — you lose the crystal structure but gain chemistry flexibility. Direct recycling preserves the crystal structure and relithiates — you save energy but lose flexibility because the output chemistry must match the input. The conventional wisdom is that direct recycling is elegant but fragile, and hydrometallurgy is brute-force but robust. I think this framing is wrong. The real question is: how fast does cathode chemistry evolve? If the industry settles on 2-3 dominant chemistries for a decade (NMC 811, LFP, maybe sodium-ion), then direct recycling wins because the input-output match is stable. If chemistry keeps evolving every 3-5 years — solid-state electrolytes, lithium-sulfur, new cathode structures — then hydrometallurgy wins because only dissolution gives you full flexibility. Nobody knows which scenario is more likely. This is the central bet in battery recycling technology strategy.

**Kenji Tanaka:** Adele is exactly right to frame it as a bet. I'll add the thermodynamic dimension. Direct recycling theoretically requires 5-10x less energy than hydrometallurgy because you're not paying the full entropy cost of dissolution and reseparation — you're just topping up the lithium and healing crystal defects. If direct recycling works at scale, it breaks my pessimism about the economics. But I'm skeptical for a specific reason: crystal structure degradation during battery operation is not uniform. After 1,000+ charge cycles, an NMC cathode has phase changes, oxygen loss, microcracking, and transition metal dissolution at the particle level. Relithiation fixes the lithium deficit but doesn't repair the structural damage. You get a cathode that has the right stoichiometry but wrong microstructure — and microstructure determines performance. The Atilium/Imperial College claim that recycled cathode performance matches virgin is extraordinary and requires extraordinary evidence. I want to see cycle life data, not just initial capacity.

**Socrate:** Kenji, you've set a high bar for direct recycling evidence. What bar do you set for the alternative? Hydrometallurgy has been practiced for decades without achieving the cost reductions that would make it universally viable. At what point would you conclude that hydrometallurgy has failed, rather than simply needing more optimization?

**Kenji Tanaka:** Fair challenge. I'd say hydrometallurgy has "failed" if, after 10 more years of process optimization and scale-up, the energy cost per kg of recovered lithium carbonate hasn't decreased by at least 40% from current levels. If the industry is still at 50-80 kWh/kg in 2035, then we're asymptotically approaching a limit that isn't the thermodynamic minimum but a practical one — and the economics will never close for low-value chemistries like LFP without permanent subsidies. That would be an honest failure.

**Clara Mwangi:** The debate I want to highlight is about timing and justice. The first large wave of EV batteries reaching end-of-life will be in 2028-2035, concentrated in China, Europe, and the US. The second wave — 2035-2045 — will include Southeast Asia, India, Africa, and Latin America. The Western and Chinese recycling industries are building infrastructure for the first wave. Nobody is planning for the second wave. The countries in the second wave are the same ones that mine the raw materials. If we build the recycling infrastructure only in consumer countries, we've completed the neocolonial circle: extract from the Global South, manufacture in the East, consume in the West, recycle in the East and West. The resource-producing nations capture zero value at any point in the lifecycle. The unanswered question is: will the second wave of battery waste create an opportunity for industrialization in the Global South, or will it become another waste colonialism problem, like e-waste in Ghana and Nigeria?

**Marcus Holloway:** Clara's timing question connects to what I think is the most underappreciated risk in the industry: the feedstock gap. Every recycling business plan I've reviewed assumes growing feedstock availability. But here's the reality. In the US and Europe in 2025, there aren't enough end-of-life EV batteries to feed the recycling capacity being built. The first-generation Nissan Leafs and Chevy Bolts are reaching end-of-life, but these are tiny volumes — tens of thousands of packs, not millions. The recycling capacity being built by Redwood, Li-Cycle, and others is designed for volumes that won't materialize until 2030+. In the meantime, they're competing for manufacturing scrap, which is the only available feedstock in volume. This creates a weird dynamic: too much recycling capacity chasing too little feedstock, leading to depressed gate fees and squeezed margins. Several recycling startups will fail in 2025-2028 not because their technology doesn't work but because they can't get enough batteries to process. Li-Cycle's difficulties are the canary in the coal mine.

**Wei Zhang:** Marcus is right about the near-term feedstock gap, and this is precisely why vertical integration matters. Brunp doesn't have a feedstock problem because CATL generates 30,000+ tonnes of manufacturing scrap per year from its own production. That's a captive, growing feedstock stream. Standalone recyclers are fighting over scraps — literally. The structural question is whether the Western battery industry will consolidate enough to enable this kind of integration, or whether it remains fragmented with separate mining companies, cathode producers, cell manufacturers, and recyclers all competing on the merchant market. My bet: the economics will force integration. In 10 years, the major Western battery companies will look structurally similar to CATL — vertically integrated from mining to recycling. But the transition will be painful, and many standalone recyclers won't survive it.

**Nikolai Petrov:** I want to name the geopolitical debate that sits underneath all of this. There are two competing visions for the battery materials supply chain. Vision one: a globalized, market-mediated supply chain where materials flow to the lowest-cost producer, regardless of geography. This is the status quo, and it leads to Chinese dominance because Chinese producers have structural cost advantages from scale, integration, and government support. Vision two: regionalized, strategically autonomous supply chains where the US, EU, and other blocs build domestic capacity for critical materials, including recycling, even when it's more expensive than importing from China. This is what the IRA and EU Battery Regulation are trying to create. The tension between these visions determines everything: what gets built, where, at what cost, and who pays. If you believe in vision one, battery recycling in the West is a subsidized boondoggle. If you believe in vision two, it's a strategic necessity worth overpaying for. The honest answer is that nobody knows which vision will prevail, and the investment decisions being made today are bets on that political outcome.

**Socrate:** Nikolai, you've framed this as a geopolitical choice between global efficiency and regional autonomy. But is there a third option that this binary obscures? Could recycling technology itself change the geopolitics — for instance, if modular, distributed recycling becomes viable, does that make the centralization-vs-regionalization debate irrelevant?

**Nikolai Petrov:** It's a genuine question, and Clara's the one to answer it. If containerized recycling at 1,000 tonnes/year becomes technically and economically viable, then yes — you've changed the game. Every country with batteries becomes a potential recycler. The supply chain geography flattens. But I'm skeptical that the physics allows it for all process steps. You can do mechanical processing and black mass production in a container. You probably can't do solvent extraction or electrochemical refining at that scale with the required purity. So you might get distributed preprocessing feeding centralized refining — which is actually how the mining industry works today, with concentrators near mines and smelters in a few locations. The question is whether that hub-and-spoke model creates the same geographic concentration Clara is trying to avoid.

**Adele Fontaine:** Let me close with the question that keeps me up at night: are we recycling the right thing? The industry is focused on recovering cathode metals — lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese. But the cathode is 30-40% of the cell by mass. What about the rest? The copper current collectors, the aluminum foil, the polymer separator, the carbon black, the binder (PVDF, which is a PFAS compound — a forever chemical that requires specialized handling). A truly closed-loop recycling process needs to handle ALL of these streams, not just the glamorous metals. The separator and binder alone create environmental liabilities that nobody is honestly addressing. PVDF incineration produces hydrogen fluoride — the most dangerous gas in industrial chemistry. If we're building an industry that recovers cobalt and lithium but dumps everything else in landfill or incinerates it with toxic emissions, we haven't solved the problem. We've just optimized for the profitable fraction and externalized the rest.

**Kenji Tanaka:** Adele's point is devastating and I want to underscore it. The industry's recovery rate numbers — "we recover 95% of cobalt" — are cherry-picked. They report the recovery rate of the valuable metals as a percentage of those metals in the input. They don't report the overall material recovery rate as a percentage of total cell mass. If you recover 95% of the cobalt but send 60% of the total cell mass to landfill or incineration, your true recycling rate is 40%. The EU regulation is starting to address this with material-specific recovery targets, but even those targets don't cover binder, separator, or electrolyte. The honest accounting of what battery "recycling" actually recycles is much less impressive than the headline numbers suggest.

**Marcus Holloway:** And that honest accounting is exactly what investors and policymakers need to see. The battery recycling industry is at a critical inflection point. It can either mature into a genuine materials recovery industry that handles the full waste stream — which requires more capital, more process complexity, and lower margins — or it can optimize for the profitable fraction and pretend the rest doesn't exist, which is what the e-waste industry did. We know how that story ended: e-waste "recycling" in Guiyu, China, where workers burned circuit boards to extract copper and gold while breathing toxic fumes. I'd rather the battery industry get ahead of that curve.
