# Iteration 1: Grande Table — Synthesis

*See main synthesis at ../synthesis.md for the complete structured output.*
*This file records the synthesis as produced directly from the Grande Table debate.*

The Grande Table produced three rounds of debate: (1) fundamentals and constraints, (2) opportunities and undervalued areas, (3) big debates and unanswered questions. The core findings are captured in the main synthesis document.

Key debate dynamics:
- Kenji and Wei provided the sharpest tension — thermodynamic constraints vs. manufacturing integration as the primary lens
- Marcus and Adele clashed on whether the problem is business model (Marcus) or chemistry (Adele)
- Clara consistently redirected from technical optimization to geographic justice
- Nikolai served as bridge between economic and physical analyses
- Socrate's interventions were most effective when challenging the nuclear reprocessing analogy (forcing Adele to acknowledge the economic gap) and when questioning whether second life solves or defers the recycling problem

Convergence was genuine on: logistics > chemistry as the binding constraint, vertical integration as the strongest model, and the feedstock gap as a near-term risk. Divergence was irreducible on: centralized vs. distributed, the role of regulation, and direct recycling viability.
