## Logical Chain Review

- The argument that chemistry evolution (NMC→LFP→Na-ion) structurally erodes recycling value is logically sound: less valuable materials per tonne → less revenue → worse economics.
- The thermodynamic argument (Gibbs free energy of mixing as a floor) is scientifically correct. The 3-4x gap between current practice and floor is stated as an estimate, appropriately flagged.
- The vertical integration argument (CATL as proof) is logically valid but dependent on CATL's self-reported profitability, which is not independently audited.

## Internal Contradictions

None found. The deliverable appropriately flags disagreements as disagreements rather than trying to resolve them artificially.

**VERDICT: PASS.** Two claims (graphite pricing range, collection cost) are plausible but could benefit from more precise sourcing. No factual errors found. No logical holes identified.
