**Context:** iteration-1
**Mode:** ask-assembly
**Question:** isnt redwood materials building new sights out of nevada

---

**Marcus Holloway:** Yes, and this is exactly why I keep pointing to Redwood as the company that actually understands the business. JB Straubel started at the Nevada site — their campus outside Reno near the Tesla Gigafactory, which is not a coincidence. That facility is already producing cathode active materials and copper foil from recycled inputs.

But the bigger move is South Carolina. They broke ground on a facility near Charleston in 2023, backed by over $2 billion in investment commitments. The strategic logic is obvious: that's where BMW, Volvo/Polestar, and soon Scout Motors are building or expanding EV manufacturing. You put your cathode material plant next to the battery cell plants and the OEM assembly plants. It's the same logic as CATL/Brunp in Foshan — minimize the distance between recycling input, cathode output, and the customer who buys the cathode.

The DOE has also backed Redwood with significant loan commitments under the IRA. They're targeting something like 100 GWh of annual cathode production capacity, which would make them one of the largest cathode material producers in North America — not just the largest recycler. That's the distinction I keep hammering: Straubel isn't building recycling plants, he's building a cathode material supply chain that uses recycled feedstock as one input. The Nevada site is the R&D and first-gen production hub. South Carolina is the scale-up play positioned in the emerging Southeast US battery belt.

**Wei Zhang:** Marcus is right on the strategy, and I want to underscore why multi-site matters from an integration standpoint. At Brunp, we scaled by co-locating with CATL's production facilities — our recycling operations sit in the same industrial parks as the cell manufacturing lines. The scrap literally travels 2 kilometers. Redwood is replicating this logic in the American context.

The Nevada site makes sense because of Tesla and Panasonic's Gigafactory. The South Carolina site makes sense because that's where the next wave of US cell manufacturing is concentrating — not just BMW but the broader Southeastern corridor. What Redwood understands, and what most Western recyclers don't, is that your plant locations should be determined by where your *customers* are (the cathode and cell manufacturers), not where the waste batteries are. The waste batteries come to you because you're the only game in town processing them. But your revenue comes from selling cathode materials, and those customers want local supply.

This is also how you solve the feedstock gap problem. In the near term, Redwood's Nevada site processes Tesla manufacturing scrap — a guaranteed, chemistry-consistent input stream, exactly like Brunp's relationship with CATL. The South Carolina site will similarly feed on manufacturing scrap from the plants being built around it. End-of-life EV batteries are gravy for 2030+, not the core business case today.

**Nikolai Petrov:** The multi-site expansion also has a geopolitical dimension worth naming. The IRA's domestic content requirements and the $45 billion in battery supply chain subsidies essentially pay Redwood to build these facilities. The DOE loan to Redwood — roughly $2 billion for the Nevada expansion — isn't a market signal, it's an industrial policy signal. The US government has decided that domestic cathode material production is a national security priority, and Redwood is the primary vehicle for that.

South Carolina specifically was chosen in part because of the state's aggressive incentive packages for battery supply chain investments, and because proximity to the Port of Charleston gives access to imported feedstock if needed. The site selection isn't just about customer proximity — it's about stacking federal IRA subsidies, state incentives, and logistics access.

This is exactly the dynamic I described in the main debate: geopolitical risk premiums create a floor under recycling economics that pure commodity math doesn't capture. Redwood's South Carolina plant probably doesn't pencil out on metal value alone at today's prices. But when you add the IRA production tax credits, the strategic value of not depending on Chinese cathode imports, and the EU-style recycled content mandates that are coming — the economics work regardless of where cobalt prices go next quarter. That's the whole point. Redwood is being built on policy floors, not commodity speculation, which is why it's the most resilient business model in the space.
