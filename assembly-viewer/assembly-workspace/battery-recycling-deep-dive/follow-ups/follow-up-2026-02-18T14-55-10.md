**Question:** would you invest in redwood materials?

**Dr. Kenji Tanaka:**

The investment case for Redwood Materials rests on one question: can they actually become a cathode material supplier, or are they a recycling company with good branding?

Here's what I'll give JB Straubel credit for. He understood early that standalone recycling is a terrible business. Selling recovered cobalt sulfate and nickel sulfate into commodity markets means you're competing against Indonesian laterite nickel and DRC cobalt — you will lose on cost. So Redwood pivoted to producing cathode active material (CAM) and anode copper foil directly. That's a $30,000-50,000/tonne product, not a $15,000-25,000/tonne intermediate. The margin structure is completely different.

But here's what worries me. Redwood's cathode material production requires battery-grade purity — we're talking 99.9%+ for NMC precursors. Getting there from mixed recycling feedstock requires extensive purification that eats into the cost advantage of using recycled inputs. At Sumitomo, we could hit 99.5% purity reliably from known-chemistry inputs. Getting that last 0.4% cost us almost as much as the first 99.5%. Redwood is claiming they can do this at scale with variable feedstock. I want to see the independent quality audits.

The second concern: their capacity targets. 100 GWh by 2025 was the claim. Where's the feedstock? End-of-life EV batteries won't arrive in volume until 2030-2032. They're processing manufacturing scrap from Tesla and Panasonic, which is great — known chemistry, clean material, short logistics chain. But manufacturing scrap is a finite feedstock that shrinks as production yields improve. Every percentage point that Tesla improves their electrode coating yield is a percentage point less scrap for Redwood.

If I had to bet: Redwood survives and becomes a meaningful cathode material supplier in North America, primarily because the IRA subsidies create a floor under their economics regardless of commodity prices. The $2 billion+ in DOE grants and loans they've attracted means the US government has effectively de-risked the downside. You're not really betting on the recycling economics — you're betting on US industrial policy continuity. That's a political bet, not a thermodynamic one. I'd put the probability of a good outcome at maybe 55-60%. Not terrible, but not the slam dunk that the cleantech press presents.

**Prof. Adele Fontaine:**

I largely agree with Kenji's framing but I'm somewhat more optimistic on the chemistry side, and here's why.

Redwood's approach — going from black mass directly to cathode active material — is actually smart process chemistry. The conventional recycling pathway is: dissolve everything → separate individual metals → sell metal salts → cathode producer recombines them into NMC precursor. That's three unnecessary transformations. Redwood skips the individual metal separation for their cathode production line, going from mixed metal solution directly to co-precipitated NMC hydroxide precursor. This is essentially what Wei Zhang describes CATL/Brunp doing, adapted for the Western market.

The purity question Kenji raises is real but manageable. The critical impurities in cathode precursors are iron, copper, zinc, and aluminum — all of which can be removed through selective pH adjustment and solvent extraction at well-understood conditions. This is not exotic chemistry. The challenge is process control at scale with variable feedstock, and that's an engineering maturation problem, not a fundamental barrier.

What I would scrutinize as an investor: their anode copper foil business. Redwood is producing copper foil from recycled copper, which is technically straightforward but a low-margin commodity product. If that's a significant portion of their near-term revenue, the margin profile is weaker than the cathode story suggests.

The real investment question is whether Redwood can secure offtake agreements with major cell manufacturers — Toyota, Panasonic, Samsung SDI — at prices that justify the capital expenditure. The IRA's domestic content requirements essentially mandate that US battery plants source materials domestically, which creates captive demand for Redwood's output. That's a structural advantage no amount of process optimization in China can overcome for the US market.

I'd invest, but with clear eyes that you're investing in an industrial policy play as much as a technology company.

**Clara Mwangi:**

I'll be direct: Redwood Materials is probably a good financial investment for the reasons Kenji and Adele described. IRA subsidies, captive domestic demand, smart business model. I don't dispute any of that.

But I want to name what Redwood represents in the bigger picture, because it matters for anyone thinking about this sector broadly.

Redwood's model works because it plugs into the existing geographic concentration of battery manufacturing. They're in Nevada, processing scrap from Tesla's Gigafactory and Panasonic's plant. Their upcoming South Carolina facility sits near BMW and other OEM battery plants. This is vertical integration within the US supply chain — it doesn't change the fundamental structure of who captures value from critical minerals.

The cobalt in those Tesla batteries still originated in the DRC. The lithium still came from Chile or Australia. Redwood captures the recycling value in the US, which is rational for a US company, but it means the recycling loop closes in the consuming country, not the producing country. The DRC gets paid once for the cobalt. The US gets paid repeatedly as it circulates.

For an investor optimizing returns, this is irrelevant. For anyone thinking about where to build recycling capacity globally, Redwood is a template for how wealthy nations will lock in secondary material supply chains the same way they locked in primary ones.

If your question is purely "will I make money," then yes, probably — the IRA floor and domestic content requirements make this closer to an infrastructure play than a commodity bet. If your question is "does this solve the battery recycling problem," the answer is it solves it for the United States. The other 7 billion people need a different model.
