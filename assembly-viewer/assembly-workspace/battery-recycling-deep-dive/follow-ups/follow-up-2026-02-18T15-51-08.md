# The Intellectual Assembly: Battery Recycling as Investment Given Rapid Technology Change

---

**Marcus Holloway:** Let me give you the investor's answer first, then complicate it. Battery recycling is a good industry to invest in — but only if you invest in the right *structure*, and most people are investing in the wrong one. The right structure is vertical integration with cathode manufacturing, à la Redwood Materials or CATL/Brunp. The wrong structure is standalone recycling selling recovered metals into commodity markets.

Here's why technology change is the central risk. Every recycling business plan I've reviewed assumes a specific cathode chemistry mix for their feedstock — say, 60% NMC, 30% LFP, 10% other. But cathode chemistry has shifted from NMC 111 to NMC 532 to NMC 622 to NMC 811, and now LFP is surging and sodium-ion is emerging. Each shift changes the recoverable value per tonne of input. NMC 111 gave you ~$8,700/tonne in recoverable metals. LFP gives you ~$3,170. Sodium-ion gives you essentially nothing worth recovering at current prices. If you've built a $200M hydrometallurgical plant optimized for NMC chemistry and the market shifts to LFP or sodium-ion faster than projected, your plant is either underutilized or processing low-value feedstock at a loss.

The vertically integrated player survives this because they're not selling metals — they're manufacturing cathode precursors. When chemistry shifts, they shift their output specification. Redwood isn't betting on cobalt prices; they're betting on being a domestic cathode material supplier regardless of chemistry. That's a structurally defensible position. Everyone else is making a commodity bet dressed up as a technology investment.

**Dr. Kenji Tanaka:** Marcus is right about the business model risk, but I want to be precise about something he's glossing over: the physics of technology change doesn't just affect the *economics* of recycling — it affects the *thermodynamic feasibility*. This matters for investors because it determines whether process improvements can save you when chemistry shifts.

Consider the trajectory. We moved from cobalt-heavy cathodes to nickel-heavy to iron-based to potentially sodium-based. Each step replaces expensive, thermodynamically favorable-to-separate metals with cheap, thermodynamically costly-to-separate ones. Cobalt at $30,000/tonne justifies the Gibbs free energy cost of selective precipitation. Iron at $100/tonne does not — and never will, regardless of process optimization. This isn't a cost curve that learning effects flatten. It's a fundamental shift in the thermodynamic value proposition of recycling.

For an investor, the question isn't "will battery recycling grow?" — obviously it will, because regulation mandates it. The question is "will it generate returns?" And the answer depends on whether you believe the industry can outrun the declining intrinsic value of its feedstock. The EU mandates 80% lithium recovery by 2031 and recycled content requirements — this creates a compliance market where gate fees replace metal value as revenue. That's a waste management business earning regulated returns, not a technology business earning venture returns. Investors expecting 20%+ IRR from recycling are pricing in metal value that the chemistry trajectory is eliminating. Investors expecting 8-12% from a regulated waste infrastructure business may do fine. Know which bet you're making.

**Dr. Wei Zhang:** Both Marcus and Kenji are analyzing this correctly within their frames, but they're missing the most important variable for an investor: *timing of feedstock availability* versus *technology change rate*.

Here's what I learned at Brunp. Today, 40% of recycling feedstock is manufacturing scrap — electrode trimmings, defective cells, formation waste. This material has *known, current* chemistry because it comes from active production lines. When cathode chemistry shifts, your scrap feedstock shifts with it automatically. You're always recycling what's being manufactured *now*, not what was manufactured ten years ago. This means the technology-change risk is largely a myth for the next 5-7 years if your feedstock is manufacturing scrap within an integrated operation.

The real technology-change risk hits when end-of-life EV batteries become the dominant feedstock — roughly 2032-2035. At that point you're processing NMC 811 and early LFP batteries while the market has moved to sodium-ion or solid-state or whatever comes next. *That's* when chemistry mismatch becomes acute. So the investment thesis has a temporal structure: manufacturing-scrap recycling integrated with cathode production is relatively safe through 2030. End-of-life recycling is a bet on either chemistry-agnostic processes (hydrometallurgy to individual metals) or on regulatory mandates creating a compliance floor. The worst investment is a standalone recycler building capacity now for end-of-life volumes that arrive in 2032 in a chemistry they can't predict. Li-Cycle's difficulties are the canary.

**Nikolai Petrov:** I want to challenge something all three of you are implicitly assuming: that the investment decision should be evaluated on intrinsic recycling economics alone. It shouldn't. The strategic risk premium is the single largest driver of recycling investment value, and technology change doesn't eliminate it — it may actually increase it.

Consider: China controls 70%+ of cobalt refining, 60%+ of lithium refining, and is building dominant positions in sodium-ion production. If battery chemistry shifts to sodium-ion, the geographic concentration of the supply chain doesn't disappear — it intensifies, because sodium-ion manufacturing is even more China-concentrated than lithium-ion. The US IRA's $45B+ in battery supply chain subsidies aren't priced to commodity economics. They're priced to the strategic cost of supply chain dependence. When the US government offers a $35/kWh production tax credit for domestic battery manufacturing, the recycled-content pathway becomes economically viable regardless of what cobalt or lithium costs on the commodity market.

For investors, this means the floor under recycling economics is geopolitical, not thermodynamic. Kenji is correct that the intrinsic metal value is declining. Marcus is correct that standalone commodity recyclers are vulnerable. But the geopolitically-motivated subsidy floor — IRA in the US, Battery Regulation in the EU, industrial policy in Japan and Korea — is the most durable revenue guarantee in the industry. Technology changes the chemistry; it doesn't change the strategic imperative for supply chain sovereignty. The best recycling investments are those positioned to capture geopolitical subsidies: domestic operations in the US, EU, Japan, or Korea, integrated with local battery manufacturing, processing whatever chemistry the market demands.

**Socrate:** Nikolai, you argue that geopolitical subsidies create a durable floor under recycling economics. But subsidies are political instruments — the IRA nearly died in Congress, and its survival depends on successive administrations. If the investment thesis rests on geopolitical will rather than intrinsic economics, how is this different from investing in any other subsidized industry that collapses when political winds shift? What specific evidence do you have that battery recycling subsidies are more durable than, say, solar tariffs that were imposed and reversed, or ethanol mandates that created then destroyed an industry?

And to all of you: you've discussed what happens when chemistry changes make recycled materials less valuable. But what if the change goes the other direction — what if solid-state batteries or some successor technology uses materials that are *more* valuable and *harder* to source than current ones? Are you all assuming technology change is unidirectional toward cheaper, more abundant materials? On what basis?

---

**Nikolai Petrov:** Socrate's first question is fair and I'll concede the vulnerability partially. Subsidies *are* politically contingent. But there's a structural difference between battery recycling subsidies and ethanol mandates. Ethanol mandates competed with a deeply entrenched fossil fuel industry that lobbied against them. Battery supply chain sovereignty has bipartisan support in the US, EU consensus, and backing from defense establishments — because the alternative is dependence on a strategic competitor. The US Department of Defense classified battery materials as critical to national security. That's a different political constituency than corn farmers. But yes — any investment thesis that relies primarily on subsidies carries political risk, and investors should discount for it. I'd price it at a 15-20% probability of significant subsidy reduction over a 10-year horizon, not zero.

**Dr. Kenji Tanaka:** On Socrate's second question — this is important. The assumption of directionality toward cheaper materials is not guaranteed. Solid-state batteries may require germanium, scandium, or rare earth elements for solid electrolytes. Some next-generation cathode designs use vanadium or niobium. If battery technology moves toward scarcer, more expensive materials, the recycling value proposition *improves*. I've been modeling the declining-value scenario because that's the current trajectory, but I should be honest: the trajectory could reverse. The history of materials science is full of surprises. An investor hedging both directions — investing in chemistry-flexible recycling infrastructure that can handle whatever the market throws at it — is making a more robust bet than one optimized for today's chemistry mix.

**Marcus Holloway:** And that brings us full circle to my original point. Chemistry-flexible means hydrometallurgical separation to individual metals, which means capital-intensive centralized plants. Or it means vertical integration where you adjust your output to match your customer's shifting needs. Either way, it means you need deep pockets and a long time horizon. This is not a venture-return investment — it's an infrastructure investment. The investors who will make money are the ones who understand they're building toll roads, not technology companies. Regulated returns, long asset lives, strategic value to governments willing to subsidize. That's a perfectly good investment — it's just not what most battery recycling pitch decks are selling.

**Synthesis:**

**Convergence:** The assembly agrees that battery recycling is investable but widely *mis*-invested. Technology change is a real and underpriced risk for standalone recyclers optimized for specific chemistries. The strongest investment structures are (1) vertically integrated operations processing manufacturing scrap with chemistry-agnostic flexibility, and (2) infrastructure plays positioned to capture geopolitical subsidies. The assembly converges on viewing recycling as a regulated infrastructure business earning 8-12% returns, not a technology venture earning 20%+. Timing matters enormously: manufacturing-scrap recycling is relatively safe through 2030; end-of-life recycling is a longer, riskier bet.

**Divergence:** Kenji and Nikolai diverge on what sets the floor — Kenji argues thermodynamics constrains returns regardless of subsidies; Nikolai argues geopolitical imperatives override thermodynamic economics. Marcus and Wei diverge on whether Western companies can replicate vertical integration without China's industrial policy infrastructure. The durability of subsidies remains contested.

**Emergent insight:** Socrate's second question surfaced something no character initially addressed: technology change is not unidirectionally bad for recycling. If next-generation batteries move toward scarcer materials (solid-state electrolytes, novel cathode chemistries), recycling's value proposition could *increase*. This means the optimal recycling investment is one that bets on chemistry flexibility rather than any specific chemistry — and that the technology-change risk, properly understood, is bidirectional. The investor who builds adaptable infrastructure is hedged against both the declining-value scenario (LFP, sodium-ion) and the increasing-value scenario (solid-state, exotic chemistries). This reframes the investment question from "will recycling be profitable?" to "who can build the most chemistry-agnostic processing capability?" — a question about engineering adaptability, not about predicting which battery wins.
