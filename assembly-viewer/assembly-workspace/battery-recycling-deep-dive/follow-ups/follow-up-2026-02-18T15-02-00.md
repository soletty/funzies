**Clara Mwangi:**

Honestly? It depends on what you mean by "invest."

If you're asking whether Redwood Materials is a well-positioned company, yes — probably the best-positioned battery recycler in the West. JB Straubel understood something most recycling founders didn't: you don't build a recycling company, you build a cathode material supply company. The vertical integration with cathode active material production means Redwood is its own customer. That eliminates the commodity price exposure that will kill standalone recyclers. They've raised over $1 billion, they have the DOE loan commitments, they have the Tesla relationship for feedstock, and they're building in Nevada where the IRA subsidies flow.

But here's what would make me hesitate — and this isn't about the company, it's about the structure.

Redwood's entire model concentrates value in one place: northern Nevada. The batteries they'll recycle come from vehicles driven across America, manufactured with cobalt from the DRC, lithium from Chile and Australia, nickel from Indonesia. The entire upstream supply chain extracts from communities in the Global South, and the recycling loop closes in the United States. Redwood captures the value of urban mining. Kolwezi captures nothing.

Now, you might say — that's not Redwood's problem to solve. And as a pure investment thesis, you'd be right. But I'd push back on that in two ways.

First, **geopolitical risk cuts both directions.** Redwood's bet is that the US will maintain IRA subsidies, that domestic battery manufacturing scales as projected, and that the feedstock materializes on schedule. If the political winds shift — and in the US they shift every four years — that $45 billion subsidy floor under the business disappears. Redwood is making a policy bet as much as a technology bet.

Second, **the feedstock timeline is real.** Right now, Redwood is processing manufacturing scrap from Tesla and Panasonic. That's a good business — consistent chemistry, short logistics, known volumes. But their valuation is priced for end-of-life EV batteries at scale, which means 2030 at the earliest, probably 2032-2035 for serious volumes. That's a long time to wait on a multi-billion-dollar bet. Marcus would tell you the same thing — the near-term feedstock gap is real.

If I had capital to deploy in this space, I'd split it. Some in Redwood or a similarly integrated Western player, yes. But I'd also look at building collection and preprocessing infrastructure in markets everyone else is ignoring — sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South America. The motorcycle and two-wheeler battery waste stream in Kenya, Nigeria, India, Vietnam is coming fast. Those batteries are small-format, lithium-ion, and nobody is building infrastructure to handle them. By 2030, that's millions of tonnes of battery waste with no collection system, no recycling pathway, and enormous environmental risk.

The returns on that investment aren't as clean on a spreadsheet. But the first mover who builds collection logistics in Lagos or Nairobi or Jakarta — even just mechanical preprocessing and black mass production that feeds into a Redwood or CATL downstream — captures a position that's very hard to replicate. And they're solving a problem that actually needs solving, not just capturing arbitrage on US industrial policy.

So: would I invest in Redwood? A qualified yes. Would I put everything there? No. The geographic concentration is a strategic weakness, and the real growth opportunity in battery recycling over the next two decades is in markets that Redwood will never serve.
