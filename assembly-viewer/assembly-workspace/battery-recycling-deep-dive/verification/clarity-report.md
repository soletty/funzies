# Clarity Audit Report

## Audience Assessment

Target: Engineer with some but limited battery knowledge.

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Technical terms explained | ✅ | NMC, LFP, cathode, anode, black mass, Gibbs free energy — all introduced with plain language |
| Assumes appropriate prior knowledge | ✅ | Assumes engineering comfort with thermodynamics, process flows, cost analysis |
| Jargon defined on first use | ✅ | "Black mass," "gate fees," "precursor hydroxide," "solvent extraction" all contextualized |
| Acronyms expanded | ✅ | NMC, LFP, PVDF, PFAS, EPR, IRA all expanded |
| Structure aids navigation | ✅ | 8 clearly titled parts, progressive from physics → economics → regulation → opportunities |
| Concrete examples support each claim | ✅ | CATL/Brunp, Redwood, Li-Cycle, specific $ figures throughout |
| "So what?" is always answered | ✅ | Part 8 explicitly addresses "what should an engineer do with this" |

## Points of Potential Confusion

1. The thermodynamic minimum discussion (Part 1) could lose readers who don't remember their thermodynamics. However, the user is an engineer, so this should be accessible.
2. The distinction between "precursor-to-precursor" and "individual metal separation" (Part 2, vertical integration section) could be clearer — adding one sentence about what NMC precursor hydroxide IS would help.

## Recommended Revision

Minor: Add a parenthetical clarification for "precursor hydroxide" in the vertical integration section.

**VERDICT: PASS with minor note.** Accessible to target audience. One minor clarification opportunity.
