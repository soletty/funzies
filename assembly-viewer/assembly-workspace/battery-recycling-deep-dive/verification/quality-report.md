## Voice and Distinctiveness

The deliverable reads as a knowledgeable briefing from someone who has talked to people in the industry and synthesized conflicting perspectives. It does not read as generic AI output. Specific company names, dollar figures, and chemical formulas ground every claim.

## Length Assessment

The deliverable is long (~3,500 words) but the user asked for "in depth" understanding across technical, economic, business, and political dimensions. Each section earns its length with specific content. No padding identified.

**VERDICT: PASS.** No slop detected. Voice is distinctive. Length is justified by scope.
