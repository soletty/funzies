# Iteration 1: Grande Table — Transcript

## Round 1: What Is the Core Problem?

**Marco Ferretti:** Let's start with what nobody wants to say. The problem isn't Raya. The problem is that most men who travel a lot use travel as a personality substitute. "I travel" is not an identity. "I travel and I know the chef at a tiny place in San Sebastián that doesn't have a website" — that's an identity. This person says they want to "rizz girls on Raya" while traveling. Fine. But rizz isn't a technique you bolt onto your profile. Rizz is the exhaust fume of an interesting life. If you're landing in a new country and your first move is to open an app, you've already lost the frame. You're positioning yourself as a consumer in a market. The women on Raya — these are creative, well-connected, interesting women — they can smell the app tourist from a kilometer away. The real question isn't "how do I optimize my Raya game across countries." It's "how do I build a life that's so genuinely compelling that Raya becomes the easiest part?"

**Nadia Okafor:** That's beautiful, Marco, and also completely useless as actionable advice. "Build a more interesting life" — with respect, that's the "draw the rest of the owl" of dating strategy. This person is already on Raya. They already travel. They have a life. The question is: are they presenting it effectively? Because I promise you, the difference between a 5% match rate and a 25% match rate is almost never the underlying life — it's the packaging. I've rebuilt profiles for men who had incredible lives and terrible profiles. Same person, same experiences, completely different results after a one-hour session. Photo sequence, song choice, bio framing, Instagram coherence — these are craft decisions that most men make badly because they've never thought of their profile as a brand asset. And on Raya specifically, where every user is pre-filtered for quality, the packaging game is even more important because the baseline is so high. You're not competing with average guys. You're competing with founders, artists, athletes. Your profile is your pitch deck.

**Jiro Tanaka:** I want to push back on both of you, because you're both making claims without evidence. Marco, when you say "build an interesting life and Raya becomes easy" — easy compared to what? What's the baseline? What's the conversion rate? Nadia, when you say packaging produces a 5x improvement — over what time horizon? In which cities? With what sample size? Here's what I actually know from tracking my own data: city selection is the single highest-leverage variable. I've had the same profile — same photos, same song, same bio — produce a 42% match-to-date conversion in Lisbon and an 11% conversion in Dubai. That's a 4x difference from location alone. Before we debate profile strategy or lifestyle philosophy, can we agree that WHERE you open the app matters more than almost anything else? Because if this person is spending equal time in, say, Dubai and Lisbon, the single most impactful thing they can do is shift time toward the higher-converting cities.

**Priya Shankar:** Jiro, your data is directionally right but you're missing the mechanism. It's not just that "Lisbon is better than Dubai" — it's that the algorithm behaves differently based on your user profile relative to the local user base. When you arrive in a new city, Raya gives you a visibility boost. I've seen this from the inside — not at Raya specifically, but the mechanic is standard across these platforms. That boost decays in 48-72 hours. If you don't capitalize on it — by being active, selective, and responsive during that window — you're competing against established local users with higher engagement histories for the rest of your stay. Jiro's city-level data is real, but some of the variance he's seeing is probably confounded with his own behavior during the boost window versus after it.

**Socrate:** I want to pause here. Four of you have spoken. Three have used the word "conversion." One has used "pitch deck." Can someone define what, exactly, is being converted? A swipe into a match? A match into a message? A message into a date? A date into a hookup? Because the strategy for each of those conversions is different, and conflating them produces confused advice. What is the actual goal — and at what stage does this person's current approach fail?

### Assembly Reactions

**Camille Devereaux:** Thank you, Socrate. This is precisely the question nobody wanted to ask. Because the answer reveals something uncomfortable. "Rizz girls on Raya" and "have girls I can see and hook up with when I arrive" are two different desires wearing the same sentence. The first is about the thrill of the chase — the dopamine of matching, the performance of attraction. The second is about logistics — having reliable sexual access in multiple cities. Esther Perel would call these the erotic and the domestic, and they require completely different strategies. If what you want is a reliable roster of women in cities you visit regularly, that's a relationship-management problem, not a profile-optimization problem. If what you want is the excitement of new connections in each city, that's a seduction problem. Which is it? Because Jiro's systems optimize for one. Marco's lifestyle serves the other. And they are not the same.

**Diego Castillo:** Camille's right but I want to add something concrete. There are actually two modes here, and most guys who travel a lot need both. Mode one: your "rotation cities" — the 4-5 cities you hit repeatedly. There, you want to build a social network and keep warm connections. Mode two: new cities you're visiting for the first time. There, you're starting cold and Raya is your primary tool. The strategy for each mode is completely different. In your rotation cities, Raya should be a supplement to your social life. In new cities, Raya is your main channel and the app game matters a lot more. So the answer to Socrate's question is: it depends on which mode you're in.

## Round 2: The Digital vs. Physical Debate

**Nadia Okafor:** Diego just made my point for me. In new cities — which sounds like a significant portion of this person's travel — Raya IS the strategy. You don't have a social network in a city you've never visited. You don't know the gallery owner. You don't know the restaurant. So can we stop pretending that "build a social infrastructure" is universal advice? For new-city cold starts, the profile and the app behavior ARE the game. Let me lay out what a properly optimized Raya profile looks like for a traveler. Photo one: strong headshot, warm lighting, direct eye contact — your billboard. Photo two: lifestyle aspiration shot — you at a beautiful dinner, well-dressed, context-rich location. Photo three: a candid social moment — you mid-laugh with one person in an interesting setting. Photo four: a travel shot that tells a specific story — not "generic beach sunset" but a moment with context. Photo five: you doing something skilled — cooking, surfing, playing music. Photo six: a slightly vulnerable or playful shot — the one that makes her feel like she's seeing the real you. Song: something specific to your taste that isn't try-hard obscure or embarrassingly mainstream. And your Instagram needs to back it up with recent stories showing you're actually living this life, not performing it for a highlight reel.

**Marco Ferretti:** I agree with your photo advice, Nadia — genuinely. That sequence is good craft. Where you lose me is when you say "Raya IS the strategy" in new cities. That's surrendering to the app's frame. Even in a city you've never visited, you have options beyond cold-swiping. You have friends of friends. You have a hotel concierge. You have the bartender at a good restaurant who, if you sit at the bar alone and are interesting to talk to, will introduce you to regulars. I was in Buenos Aires for the first time last year. I didn't know anyone. I booked a seat at a chef's table dining experience — twelve strangers, good wine, four hours. Met three incredible women, not through an app, but through the simple act of being present in a room and being someone worth talking to. One of them I later matched with on Raya and she said, "Oh, you're the guy from the dinner!" That converted to a date in one message. Raya was the closing mechanism, not the discovery channel.

**Jiro Tanaka:** Marco, that's a lovely story. It's also an N of 1 from a charming Italian photographer. How replicable is "sit at a chef's table and be magnetic"? My data says that for the average traveling professional — not a photographer, not a nightlife promoter, just someone who works in tech or finance and happens to travel — Raya is their highest-throughput channel in new cities. The question isn't whether Marco's approach is better in theory. It's whether it's executable for the person asking.

**Socrate:** Jiro raises replicability. But I want to press on something else. Nadia, you described a six-photo sequence designed to create a specific impression. Marco, you described an evening designed to create a specific impression. Both of you are designing an experience for a potential partner to consume. Both involve curation, strategy, and deliberate choices about what to show and what to hide. So my question is: what is the actual difference between optimizing a profile and optimizing a life? Are these different activities, or the same activity on different timescales?

### Assembly Reactions

**Camille Devereaux:** Socrate, that's the question. And the answer is this: the difference is in what you're left with when the performance ends. When you optimize a profile, you create an expectation. When you optimize a life, you create a reality. The problem isn't that Nadia's approach is dishonest — it isn't. The problem is that it creates a gap between the profile and the person. And that gap is where attraction dies. A woman matches with a profile that promises sophistication, curiosity, adventure. She meets a man who is... fine. Nice. Normal. The gap between the promise and the delivery is the most lethal thing in modern dating. It's worse than a bad profile, because a bad profile sets low expectations that can be exceeded. A great profile sets high expectations that are almost always betrayed. So my position is this: any strategy that optimizes the profile faster than it optimizes the person is building a bridge to nowhere.

**Priya Shankar:** Camille's making a philosophical point. Let me make a practical one. The gap problem she describes is real but it's not symmetrical. An under-optimized profile for an interesting person means he never gets the match. An over-optimized profile for a boring person means he gets the match and blows it. But here's the thing: you can fix the date. You can't fix the match you never got. So the rational strategy is: optimize the profile to get in the door, then rely on your actual qualities to keep the door open. The cost of over-optimizing the profile is a bad first date. The cost of under-optimizing the profile is invisibility. I'd rather have a bad first date than no first date.

**Diego Castillo:** Can I bring this back to earth? We're debating theory while this person is probably about to fly somewhere next week. The real question is: what's the 80/20? What are the few high-leverage things that will make the biggest difference immediately? Because most guys don't need a philosophy of dating. They need to know: fix these three things on your profile, do this when you land in a new city, and avoid these two mistakes.

## Round 3: The Strategy — What Actually Works for a Traveler?

**Priya Shankar:** Let me start with the algorithmic layer since nobody else will. Three things the user should do with their Raya behavior, starting today. One: when you arrive in a new city, be highly active on the app within the first 48 hours. This is your visibility window. Swipe selectively — right on your top 30-40% only. Respond to matches within a few hours, not days. Two: make sure your profile is 100% complete — all six photos, song, bio filled out, Instagram linked and current. Incomplete profiles get shown less. Three: be consistent but not obsessive — daily usage in short sessions signals quality to the algorithm. Binge sessions don't.

**Nadia Okafor:** Building on Priya's algorithm layer, here's the creative layer. The user needs to audit their profile RIGHT NOW with this framework: Does photo one stop the scroll? Is the song a genuine taste signal? Does the Instagram grid look like it belongs to the same person as the Raya profile? And for a traveler specifically, photos should show range — different cities, different contexts, different moods — but not scream "I'm never in one place." Women on Raya are already skeptical of travelers. Your photos should say "I'm a person who happens to travel" not "I'm a tourist."

**Marco Ferretti:** Here's what I'd add at the lifestyle layer. For your rotation cities — the ones you visit every few months — invest in learning three things: the name of one excellent restaurant that locals love, enough of the local language to order and flirt badly, and one cultural activity you genuinely enjoy in that city. These three things transform you from "guy on Raya who's in town for a week" to "guy who actually knows this place." That transformation changes how you show up on dates and how women experience you. It's the difference between "let's go to the place I googled" and "there's this place in the 11th I love — have you been?"

**Jiro Tanaka:** I want to inject some structure here. The user said they travel to the US, Europe, Dubai, and South America. Let me segment this. US and European creative hubs (New York, LA, London, Paris, Berlin, Lisbon, Barcelona) — these are high-density Raya markets with a culture of casual dating. Highest expected ROI. Focus time here. Dubai — low conversion for casual dating. Raya in Dubai skews toward women seeking serious relationships or specific lifestyle access. Don't waste energy here. South America (Bogotá, Buenos Aires, São Paulo, Mexico City) — variable by city, but generally receptive to the "interesting traveler" frame. Good ROI, especially if you speak any Spanish or Portuguese. My recommendation: map your travel schedule and weight your dating investment toward the high-conversion cities. Don't put equal effort everywhere.

**Socrate:** Everyone has offered tactical advice. All of it assumes our user is attractive enough that the bottleneck is strategy, not fundamentals. But we don't know that. We don't know what he looks like. We don't know his social skills. We don't know his current profile. We don't know his match rate. So let me ask: are you all giving advice for the general case, or are you assuming specific things about this person? And if you're assuming — what are you assuming, and what happens to your advice if those assumptions are wrong?

### Assembly Reactions

**Camille Devereaux:** Socrate is right to flag this. Everything we've said assumes a baseline of physical attractiveness and social competence. But I want to add a more uncomfortable assumption we're making: we're assuming that the "hookup in every city" lifestyle is actually going to make this person happy. I'm not moralizing — I've treated patients who lived this life and loved it, and patients who lived it and it hollowed them out. The question is: does he know which one he is? Because the strategy for "I want exciting casual connections with fascinating women around the world" is very different from the strategy for "I want to feel less lonely when I travel." And both of those get described as "rizz girls on Raya."

**Diego Castillo:** Camille, with respect — he didn't ask for a therapy session. He asked for a strategy. I want to address Socrate's point about assumptions though. Even without knowing his profile, here's advice that works regardless of his attractiveness level: build social infrastructure. The guy who knows someone in every city — even ONE person who can invite him to one dinner — has a structural advantage over the guy who's purely app-dependent, no matter what he looks like. My one concrete piece of advice: before your next trip to any city, reach out to every person you know who's been there. Ask for one introduction. One. That introduction cascades. This costs nothing and works for everyone.

**Marco Ferretti:** And I want to support what Diego just said while connecting it back to Raya specifically. The best Raya conversations I've ever had started with context. "I'm coming to Barcelona next week" is weak. "I'm coming to Barcelona next week — my friend Maria who runs a gallery there told me I can't miss the opening at Espai Tactel" is strong. It gives her something to react to. It positions you as someone embedded in a world, not floating through it. Even if "Maria" is someone you met once at a party — the specificity creates the impression of a connected life.

**Priya Shankar:** I want to acknowledge Camille's point — it's valid — and also note that from the data I've seen, the men who do best on dating apps long-term are the ones who are genuinely enjoying the process, not the ones who treat it as a numbers game they're trying to win. The algorithm can't detect happiness, but the women on the other side can. The energy of "I'm having a great time and I'd love to share it with someone" converts at 3x the rate of "I need to maximize my hookup rate across geographies." So even from a pure optimization standpoint, Camille's psychological point has practical implications.

## Round 4: The Travel-Specific Challenge

**Camille Devereaux:** I want to make one more point about the psychology of the traveling man on Raya, because this is where I think the biggest opportunity lies and nobody has mentioned it. The traveler has a structural advantage that most men don't recognize: built-in scarcity. You're leaving. This is not a manipulation technique — it's a real fact of your life. And scarcity, as Lacan understood, is the engine of desire. The "just passing through" frame creates urgency without you having to manufacture it. The mistake most traveling men make is they try to hide their transience — "oh I'm here pretty often" — because they think women won't be interested in someone leaving. The opposite is true. "I'm here for two weeks and I want to make the most of it" is one of the most attractive frames in dating. It says: I'm not looking to waste your time. This isn't going to be complicated. Let's enjoy each other. Women on Raya are sophisticated enough to appreciate that frame IF — and this is the critical if — it's delivered with warmth and presence, not with the transactional efficiency of someone booking an Uber.

**Jiro Tanaka:** I actually agree with Camille here, which surprises me. The "I'm leaving" frame reduces friction on both sides. She doesn't have to worry about rejecting a guy she'll keep seeing in her social circle. He doesn't have to worry about long-term expectations. The reduced stakes paradoxically increase the likelihood of the date happening. I've seen this in my data: my match-to-date conversion rate is consistently 15-20% higher when I'm transparent about my travel timeline versus when I'm vague about it.

**Nadia Okafor:** This is where the bio becomes critical for a traveler. Your bio should do two things: signal that you're interesting enough to match with, and signal that you're transient enough to remove commitment pressure. Something like "Creative director splitting time between NYC and wherever the work takes me. In [city] through [month]. Always looking for the restaurant a local would actually eat at." It positions you as high-value (creative director), contextualizes your travel (work, not app-touring), creates a time frame (scarcity), and opens a conversational door (restaurant recommendation). That's four strategic functions in three sentences.

**Diego Castillo:** I like that bio, Nadia. But here's what elevates it from good to great: if his Instagram stories, which she WILL check, show him actually at local restaurants, actually with interesting people, actually doing things in the city — not just at the tourist spots. The bio makes a promise. The Instagram delivers on it. Most guys have a bio that says "adventurer" and an Instagram that's airplane windows and hotel lobby selfies. That gap is what kills them.

**Socrate:** We've now built a fairly comprehensive strategy. But I notice something missing from this entire conversation. We've discussed how to get matches, how to convert matches to dates, how to position yourself as an attractive traveler. We haven't discussed something rather important: what happens when it works? What does a "successful" execution of this strategy actually look like week to week? And is it sustainable across months and years of travel? Because the question wasn't about one trip — it was about a lifestyle.

### Assembly Reactions

**Marco Ferretti:** Socrate raises something real. I've lived this. There's a point where the rotation of cities, profiles, first dates, the same getting-to-know-you conversations — it becomes exhausting. The irony of the optimized traveling dating life is that it can feel like work, and the moment it feels like work, the thing that made you attractive — your energy, your spontaneity, your genuine interest in people — dies. My advice: build in periods where you don't date at all. Where you're in a city and you're not on the app and you're just living. That reserves the energy for when you are active. Burnout is real, even in dating.

**Priya Shankar:** I want to add a technical sustainability note. If you're constantly deleting and recreating profiles, or going inactive for long periods and then binging, the algorithm notices. The sustainable approach — from a platform mechanics standpoint — is consistent moderate engagement. Think of your Raya as a garden, not a hunt. Regular light maintenance produces better long-term results than sporadic intensive campaigns.

**Camille Devereaux:** And from a psychological sustainability standpoint — the men I've seen do this best long-term are the ones who genuinely enjoy meeting new people. Not as a conquest, not as a number, but as a genuine human pleasure. The curiosity has to be real. If you find yourself on a date thinking about the next date, you've already lost — not the woman, yourself.

**Diego Castillo:** I want to end with something practical about sustainability. The social infrastructure I keep talking about? It compounds. The first time you visit Mexico City and know nobody, it's hard. The second time, you know three people. The third time, you know ten. By the fifth visit, you walk into a bar and someone waves you over. That's when Raya becomes easy — not because of the algorithm, but because you've stopped being a tourist and started being a regular. That transition from tourist to regular is the single most important shift a traveling dater can make. Everything else is tactics.

**Jiro Tanaka:** I'll close with a concession. My data-driven approach captures the what but not the why. I know that Lisbon converts at 42% and Dubai at 11%, but Camille and Marco are right that the best dates — the ones I remember, the ones where I felt something genuine — they didn't come from optimizing a spreadsheet. They came from moments I couldn't have predicted or engineered. The spreadsheet got me in the room. Being human kept me there. So maybe the real framework is: use data to choose the room, use craft to open the door, and then put the phone away and be a person.
