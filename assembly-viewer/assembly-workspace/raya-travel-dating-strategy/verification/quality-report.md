# Quality Report

## Slop Test

- "In today's rapidly evolving landscape" — NOT FOUND. PASS.
- "It's important to note" / "It's worth noting" — NOT FOUND. PASS.
- "Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally" as paragraph transitions — NOT FOUND. PASS.
- "Nuanced/Multifaceted/Holistic/Synergy/Stakeholders" — NOT FOUND. PASS.
- Perfect rhetorical balance with no opinion — NOT FOUND. The deliverable takes clear positions (e.g., "city selection matters," "own your transience," specific photo order). PASS.
- Conclusion restates introduction — NOT FOUND. The sustainability section adds new content. PASS.
- Generic lists without depth — NOT FOUND. All lists have specific, actionable detail. PASS.
- Hedging into meaninglessness — NOT FOUND. Claims are stated directly. PASS.

## Voice Test
The deliverable has a distinctive voice: direct, specific, slightly irreverent ("pitch deck in Comic Sans," "La Rambla tapas disaster"). It reads as written by a specific person with opinions, not by a committee. PASS.

## Discomfort Test
The city-tier list will make some readers uncomfortable (categorizing cities by dating ROI). The "don't date in every city" advice pushes against the maximizer instinct. The "check in with yourself" section challenges the assumption that more = better. PASS.

## Specificity Test
- Specific photo descriptions, not vague advice. PASS.
- Specific bio template with example. PASS.
- Specific timing windows (48 hours, 2-4 hour response, 5-8 messages). PASS.
- Specific message examples (bad/good/best). PASS.

## Verdict: PASS
No slop detected. Voice is distinctive. Advice is specific and actionable.
