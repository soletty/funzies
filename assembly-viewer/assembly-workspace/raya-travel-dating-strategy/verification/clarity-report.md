# Clarity Report

## Audience Test
Target audience: a man who travels frequently, is already on Raya, and wants better results. The deliverable assumes no specialized knowledge of marketing, psychology, or platform economics. All frameworks are translated into plain language. PASS.

## Jargon Check
- "Conversion" used a few times in context where meaning is obvious (match → date). PASS.
- "Social proof" used once — meaning is clear from context. PASS.
- No unexplained acronyms. PASS.
- No academic language bleeding through from the debate. PASS.

## Structure Test
The deliverable is organized as a sequential playbook: fix profile → learn app mechanics → understand the two modes → pick your cities → nail the date → sustain it. This follows the user's journey logically. PASS.

## Actionability Test
Every section ends with something the user can DO, not just think about:
- Part 1: Rebuild your profile (this weekend)
- Part 2: Follow the 48-hour protocol
- Part 3: Categorize your cities into modes
- Part 4: Allocate energy by tier
- Part 5: Three date rules
- Part 6: Build in rest
PASS.

## Verdict: PASS
A traveling professional with no background in dating strategy, marketing, or psychology could read this and execute it within a week.
