# Reality Report

## Has This Been Tried?
Variations of this strategy are practiced by digital nomads, frequent business travelers, and dating coaches. The specific synthesis — combining algorithm awareness, profile craft, city segmentation, and social infrastructure — is not commonly packaged together. The individual components are validated by multiple sources.

## Most Likely Failure Modes

1. **The profile is not the bottleneck.** If the user's issue is fundamentals (attractiveness, fitness, conversational ability), this entire strategy optimizes the wrong layer. The deliverable acknowledges this in the synthesis but doesn't address it in the playbook. *Acceptable — the user asked for a Raya strategy, not a self-improvement plan. But worth flagging.*

2. **The 48-hour window is mentally demanding.** Arriving in a new city jet-lagged and immediately running a disciplined Raya protocol requires energy that may not be available. *Mitigated by: the protocol explicitly suggests waiting 6 hours before starting.*

3. **Social infrastructure takes time to build.** The rotation-city advice (know a restaurant, know a person, learn the language) is excellent but slow. Results won't appear for 2-3 return visits. *Acceptable — the deliverable frames this as "build over time," not "do immediately."*

4. **City tier list may not match his actual travel.** If his work requires heavy Dubai time and light Lisbon time, the tier advice creates frustration without options. *The deliverable could be stronger here — it says "adjust expectations" for low-tier cities but doesn't offer much alternative strategy for those cities specifically.*

## Implementation Feasibility
- Profile rebuild: feasible this weekend if he has good photos. If not, getting quality photos is a prerequisite that takes longer. PASS.
- 48-hour protocol: feasible if adopted as a habit. PASS.
- City playbooks: feasible, 30 minutes of research per city. PASS.
- Social infrastructure: feasible but slow. Requires extroversion and follow-through. PASS with caveat.

## Right Level of Process?
This problem is well-suited to adversarial deliberation. The tensions between optimization/authenticity, digital/physical, and measurement/presence are genuine and produced a more complete strategy than any single perspective would have. The process added value. PASS.

## Verdict: PASS
The strategy is implementable, grounded in real mechanics, and accounts for its own limitations. The main risk — that the bottleneck isn't strategy but fundamentals — is acknowledged but not solved, which is appropriate given the scope of the request.
