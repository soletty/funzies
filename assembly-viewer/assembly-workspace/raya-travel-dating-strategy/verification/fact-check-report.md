# Fact-Check Report

## Claims Verified

1. **Raya has ~8% acceptance rate.** Confirmed by multiple sources (Tawkify, DatingByBlaine, Roast Dating). PASS.

2. **Raya profiles are 6-photo slideshows with music.** Confirmed by app documentation and reviews. PASS.

3. **Raya has GPS-based social mode and pay-to-DM.** Confirmed by app features documentation. PASS.

4. **Raya requires Instagram linkage.** Confirmed by multiple sources. PASS.

5. **"New user boost" exists on dating platforms.** This is well-documented across Tinder, Bumble, Hinge. Not specifically confirmed for Raya's algorithm. The deliverable appropriately hedges this: "Dating apps give newly-arrived profiles a visibility boost. This is standard platform design... On Raya, this likely means..." PASS with caveat noted.

6. **Jiro's 42% vs 11% conversion data.** This is a fictional character's data used to illustrate a principle (city selection matters). The deliverable does not present this as factual data — it informed the debate but isn't cited in the deliverable. PASS.

7. **Cultural attitudes toward casual dating vary by region.** General claim supported by cultural analysis and digital nomad dating research. The tier list is informed by this but acknowledges it's directional. PASS.

## Logical Flow

- The two-mode framework (rotation vs. new cities) → different strategies is logically sound. PASS.
- The 48-hour window argument combines platform mechanics + novelty psychology + practical energy management. All three supports are independent and coherent. PASS.
- "Transparency about travel is an asset" is supported by scarcity psychology (Lacan/Perel) + practical logic (reduces commitment pressure). No logical holes. PASS.

## Verdict: PASS
No factual errors found. Hedging is appropriately placed on uncertain claims (algorithm specifics). No internal contradictions detected.
