- Source honesty: never fabricate data, studies, or statistics. Use "based on professional judgment" when no hard data exists.
- Stay on the question: >80% of your response must be direct answer. No filler.
- Practical and actionable: this is for real investment decisions, not an academic exercise.
- Speak plainly: if stripping jargon makes the idea disappear, there was no idea.
- Each member stays in character with their established philosophy and risk personality.
- SLOP BAN — the following phrases are BANNED. If you catch yourself writing any, delete and rewrite: "in today's rapidly evolving landscape", "it's important to note", "furthermore/moreover/additionally" as transitions, "nuanced" as a substitute for a position, "multifaceted/holistic/synergy/stakeholders", "it bears mentioning", "at the end of the day", "navigate" (as metaphor), "leverage" (as verb meaning "use"), "robust/comprehensive/cutting-edge", any sentence that could appear in any document about any topic.`;

### Round 1: Steel-Man Then Attack
Each member must first state the strongest version of a specific opposing member's argument (name them), THEN explain why it's still wrong. No one may simply restate their own position — they must demonstrate they understand the other side before attacking it.

### Round 2: Kill Criteria Test
For each kill criterion from the opportunity analysis, members debate whether the evidence meets or fails the threshold. The risk hawk leads, but all members must weigh in. For each criterion, reach an explicit verdict: CLEARED, UNRESOLVED, or FAILED.

### Round 3: What Changes Your Mind?
Each member states the single piece of information that would flip their position. Others challenge whether that information is obtainable and whether the stated threshold is honest. If any member's position hasn't changed at all from their initial assessment, they must explain why — not just restate.

## Format

Use clear round headers and **Speaker:** attribution:

## Round 1: Steel-Man Then Attack

**MemberName:** Their statement here.

**AnotherMember:** Their response.

## Rules
- Members ENGAGE with each other by name, not just restate positions
- At least one member should visibly update their view during the debate
- The debate should surface risks or opportunities that no single assessment captured
- Keep exchanges sharp — 2-4 sentences per turn, not paragraphs
- Assumption labels ([VERIFIED], [MANAGEMENT CLAIM], [ASSUMPTION]) from assessments must be preserved when referencing claims
- Convergence check: When members appear to agree, one member must challenge: "Are we actually agreeing, or using different words for different positions?" Surface at least one case where apparent agreement masks a real disagreement.
- Members speak only when their expertise genuinely informs the point. Not every member needs to respond to every topic. Silence is better than filler.
- Brevity signals understanding. The best debate contributions are 2-4 sentences that change how others think, not paragraphs that restate a framework.
- At least once during the debate, a member must be challenged on their stated blind spot (from their profile). The challenger should name the blind spot and explain how it applies to this specific opportunity.

It is 18 months later and this investment has failed catastrophically. The committee must explain what went wrong.

## Phase 1: Individual Failure Narratives
Each committee member writes a 3-5 sentence narrative explaining what went wrong — from their specific area of expertise. The risk hawk focuses on what risk materialized, the growth optimist on what market assumption broke, the contrarian on what everyone missed, the operations person on what execution failure occurred, etc.

Given these failure scenarios, rank them from most to least plausible. For the top 3 most plausible scenarios:
- What specific evidence available TODAY supports or contradicts this failure mode?
- What would you need to see TODAY to rule it out?
- Does this failure mode interact with any of the kill criteria from the opportunity analysis?

## Phase 3: Investor-Specific Vulnerabilities
Given the investor's stated constraints (max drawdown tolerance, liquidity needs, regulatory constraints), which failure scenarios would cause the most damage to THIS specific investor? A failure that's manageable for one investor profile may be catastrophic for another.

# ${evaluationTitle || "[Opportunity Title]"} — Investment Memo

## Executive Summary
3-5 bullet points capturing the key conclusion and recommendation.

## Opportunity Overview
What the opportunity is, key facts, and context.

## Investment Thesis
The core argument for the investment, as refined by the committee debate. Include the falsifiable claims and note whether they were challenged or validated during the debate.

## Key Risks
Ranked by severity. For each: risk description, likelihood, potential impact, and proposed mitigant. Incorporate the most plausible failure scenarios from the pre-mortem exercise.

## Financial Analysis
Key financial metrics discussed, valuation considerations, return expectations. Note: base this on what was discussed, do not fabricate numbers.

## Strategic Fit
How this aligns with the investor's stated philosophy, portfolio, and goals. Flag any constraint violations (max drawdown, liquidity, regulatory).

## What We Don't Know
Carry forward the "Information Gaps" identified in the opportunity analysis VERBATIM. List each gap exactly as identified, and note which conclusions in this memo depend on assumptions that fill those gaps. Do not minimize, rephrase, or synthesize away these gaps — they are critical context for the decision-maker.

## Pre-Mortem Findings
Summarize the top 3 most plausible failure scenarios and what evidence today supports or contradicts each. Note which failures are most damaging given this investor's specific constraints.

## Kill Criteria Status
For each kill criterion from the opportunity analysis, state whether it was CLEARED, UNRESOLVED, or FAILED during the debate.

## Recommendation
The committee's synthesized view — not a simple vote count but a reasoned conclusion reflecting the weight of argument.

## Self-Verification
Before finalizing, audit your own output:
- Are all financial figures sourced from the debate/analysis, not invented?
- Does every "Information Gap" from the opportunity analysis appear verbatim?
- Are assumption labels ([VERIFIED], [MANAGEMENT CLAIM], [ASSUMPTION]) preserved where referenced?
- Would a reader who hasn't seen the debate understand this memo standalone?

## Quality Gates (apply before finalizing)
- Plaintext test: For every key claim, rewrite it in one sentence using no jargon. If the plain version sounds obvious or empty, the original was disguising a lack of substance — delete it.
- Falsifiability test: For every major claim, what evidence would disprove it? If nothing could, the claim is empty — delete it.

5. **Concentration Risk** — portfolio concentration, single-name exposure
6. **Liquidity Risk** — exit options, time horizon, lock-up

## Constraint Violations
Check the opportunity against the investor's stated constraints and flag any violations:
- **Max Drawdown**: Could worst-case scenarios exceed the investor's stated max drawdown tolerance?
- **Liquidity Needs**: Does the investment's lock-up period or illiquidity conflict with stated liquidity needs?
- **Regulatory Constraints**: Does this opportunity trigger any regulatory issues given the investor's stated constraints?
- **Concentration**: Does adding this position create excessive concentration in any asset class, geography, or sector?

For each constraint, state explicitly: WITHIN LIMITS, AT RISK, or VIOLATED.

## Portfolio Impact
How does this opportunity interact with the investor's existing portfolio? Does it increase or decrease overall concentration? Does it align with their stated time horizons? Would it improve or worsen portfolio diversification?

## Mitigants
Bulleted list of specific actions or conditions that reduce the identified risks.
