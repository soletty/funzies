# Quality Report

## Verdict: PASS

### Slop Test: Clean
- No "rapidly evolving landscape" or variants
- No "it's important to note" or "it's worth noting"
- No "furthermore/moreover/additionally" paragraph transitions
- No "nuanced/multifaceted/holistic/synergy"
- Positions are specific and opinionated, not hedged
- Concrete line counts, file names, and code examples throughout

### Voice: Distinctive
- The deliverable has a clear engineering voice — direct, specific, decision-oriented
- Architecture diagram uses ASCII, not abstraction
- The "What NOT to Build Yet" section takes clear positions
- Decision points left to the user are genuine questions, not fake choices

### Unnecessary complexity: None detected
- The architecture is minimal — one new endpoint, vanilla JS, file persistence
- No over-engineering: no database, no framework, no auth, no session store
- The "thin bridge" metaphor accurately describes the proposal

### Length: Appropriate
- The deliverable is comprehensive but not padded. Each section adds information.
