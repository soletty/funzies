# Clarity Report

## Verdict: PASS

### Audience comprehension: A developer familiar with Node.js and web development would understand this in one reading.
- Architecture diagram is clear and uses concrete HTTP methods / data formats
- File change list is specific (file paths, approximate line counts)
- Code examples are real (SSE handling, CLI invocation)
- Migration path explains how new code relates to existing code

### Jargon check:
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) — explained implicitly through usage context and code example
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) — mentioned but explicitly deferred; not required for understanding
- CRDT — mentioned only in character voices (debate transcript), not in deliverable

### Assumptions stated:
- Claude Code must be installed on the machine
- The viewer runs locally (not remotely hosted)
- The user's team uses Claude Code as their AI interface

### No points of confusion identified.
