# SECTION 1: BORING ROBOTICS — Labor-Scarce Verticals ($7M Allocation)

## 1A. Agricultural Robotics

### John Deere (NYSE: DE) — PUBLIC
- **Market Cap:** ~$163B (Feb 2026)
- **Revenue (TTM):** $45.6B (down 11.5% YoY due to ag cycle downturn)
- **Net Income:** $5.0B (down 29.2%)
- **PE Ratio:** 32.6x (premium valuation)
- **Products:** Autonomous 8R tractor (fully driverless, commercially available); See & Spray Ultimate (precision herbicide application using computer vision, reduces herbicide use 60-77%); ExactApply; StarFire GPS guidance
- **Deployment:** See & Spray deployed on 20M+ acres. Autonomous tractor in limited commercial deployment since 2023, expanding to row-crop production. Over 500K connected machines in fleet
- **Robotics Strategy:** Acquired Blue River Technology (2017, $305M); Bear Flag Robotics (2021, ~$250M). Target: full autonomy across product line by 2030
- **Key Risks:** Ag cycle downturn suppressing farmer capex; premium pricing limits adoption; competition from CNH/AGCO in autonomy; regulatory uncertainty for fully autonomous operation on public roads
- **Investment Thesis:** Dominant platform play — owns the hardware, data, and dealer network. Robotics/autonomy drives margin expansion and recurring revenue (SaaS-like precision ag subscriptions)

### Carbon Robotics — PRIVATE
- **Valuation:** Not publicly disclosed; estimated $300-500M post-Series D
- **Total Funding:** ~$157M+ (Series D: $70M in Oct 2024; prior rounds ~$87M)
- **Revenue:** Not disclosed; estimated $20-40M ARR based on unit deployments
- **Products:** LaserWeeder (tractor-pulled, 30 lasers, kills 200K weeds/hour with thermal energy); newly announced Carbon AutoTractor for autonomous operation
- **Deployment:** Commercially deployed across specialty crop farms in the US; active in onions, carrots, broccoli, cotton, other row crops
- **Key Investors:** BOND, Anthos Capital, Fuse Venture Partners, Waymo alum founders
- **Key Risks:** Hardware scaling challenges; high unit cost (~$1M+ per unit); competition from chemical herbicides on price; seasonal revenue concentration
- **Investment Thesis:** Clear ROI for farmers (eliminates herbicide cost, reduces labor). Laser weeding is a durable moat — no herbicide resistance. AutoTractor adds autonomy layer

### Aigen — PRIVATE
- **Valuation:** Not publicly disclosed; estimated $100-200M range
- **Total Funding:** ~$20-30M (backed by NEA, Bessemer Venture Partners, AgFunder)
- **Products:** Element robot — solar-powered, autonomous weeding robot using AI vision and mechanical strikes (no chemicals). Operates in mesh network swarms
- **Deployment:** Early commercial deployment; pilot programs with specialty crop growers
- **Key Risks:** Very early stage; solar power limits to daylight/clear conditions; mechanical weeding speed vs. chemical; scaling fleet manufacturing

- **Key Risks:** Indoor farming economics remain challenging; high capex; competition from AppHarvest cautionary tale

### AppHarvest — DEFUNCT
- **Status:** Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2023; assets sold at auction
- **Peak Valuation:** Went public via SPAC in 2021 at ~$1B valuation
- **What Happened:** Built large-scale indoor farms in Kentucky; struggled with execution, crop yields, and unit economics. Stock fell from $40+ to pennies. CEO Jonathan Webb ousted amid accusations of misleading investors (SEC investigation)
- **Lesson:** Cautionary tale for controlled-environment agriculture at scale. Technology alone does not overcome agricultural economics

### Harvest CROO Robotics — PRIVATE
- **Total Funding:** ~$30M+ (venture + strategic from strawberry growers)
- **Products:** Automated strawberry harvesting system; AI-driven ripeness detection, robotic picking, in-field packing
- **Deployment:** Active during 2024-2025 Florida growing season; commercially deployed but limited scale

- **Status:** Significantly scaled back amid Intel's financial challenges (2024-2025). Less active in new robotics investments
- **Evaluation:** Reduced relevance due to Intel's corporate struggles

### Qualcomm Ventures
- **AUM:** ~$2B+
- **Robotics Relevance:** Qualcomm RB5/RB6 robotics platforms; invests in companies using Qualcomm chips in robots
- **Evaluation:** Strategic CVC; good for co-investment on companies using Qualcomm's robotics compute platform

## Tier 3: PE/Strategic Acquirers Active in Industrial Automation

### Danaher (NYSE: DHR)
- **Market Cap:** ~$170B
- **Strategy:** "Danaher Business System" (DBS) — acquires and optimizes industrial technology companies
- **Relevant History:** Previously owned automation businesses (spun off as Fortive in 2016). Pall, Beckman Coulter, Leica Microsystems — all have robotics/automation components
- **Evaluation:** DBS is the gold standard for industrial M&A. Potential acquirer of robotics companies, but now focused more on life sciences

### Roper Technologies (NYSE: ROP)
- **Market Cap:** ~$60B
- **Strategy:** Acquires asset-light, high-margin industrial software and technology companies
- **Relevant:** Vertafore, Deltek, other industrial software. Not directly in robotics hardware
- **Evaluation:** Model for how robotics software companies might be valued/acquired

### Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK)
- **Market Cap:** ~$30B
- **Strategy:** Industrial automation platform; acquires to build out connected enterprise capabilities
- **Key Acquisition:** Clearpath Robotics/OTTO Motors ($1.37B in 2023) — biggest robotics acquisition in recent years
- **Evaluation:** MOST RELEVANT industrial acquirer for robotics. Clearpath/OTTO acquisition shows willingness to pay premium for autonomous robotics. Key potential exit partner for portfolio companies

### Teradyne (NYSE: TER)
- **Market Cap:** ~$20B
- **Robotics Division:** Owns Universal Robots (cobots, ~$300M revenue) and MiR (mobile robots, ~$100M revenue)
- **Evaluation:** Publicly traded way to get pure cobot exposure. UR is market leader in collaborative robots

## Tier 4: Family Offices and Emerging Funds

### Robotics-Specific Funds
- **Robo Global** — operates ROBO ETF (NYSE: ROBO, ~$1B AUM); provides robotics/AI index exposure
- **Innovation Works** (Li Kaifu) — strong robotics investments in China
- **Coatue Management** — active in robotics (invested in Figure, physical AI)
- **T. Rowe Price** — growth equity in later-stage robotics (invested in Gecko Robotics)

### Notable Family Offices
- **Bloomberg Beta** — some robotics exposure through AI/automation
- **Koch Disruptive Technologies** — investments in industrial robotics/automation
- **Emerson Collective** — some robotics investments
- **Key Insight:** Most family offices investing in robotics do so through fund vehicles rather than direct. A robotics-focused fund-of-funds could be the product they want

# SECTION 5: KEY RISKS AND DEAD/DYING COMPANIES

## Confirmed Dead/Acquired (Remove from Consideration)
- **Abundant Robotics** — Shut down 2021 (apple harvesting too hard)
- **AppHarvest** — Bankrupt July 2023 (indoor farming economics failed)
- **FarmWise** — Acquired by John Deere 2023
- **Canvas** — Acquired by Hilti 2023
- **Clearpath/OTTO** — Acquired by Rockwell Automation 2023 ($1.37B)
- **ZenRobotics** — Acquired by TOMRA 2023
- **Intel RealSense** — Discontinued 2021-2022
- **Velodyne** — Merged into Ouster 2023

## Status Uncertain / Watch List
- **Iron Ox** — Website redirects; possible wind-down; high burn rate
- **Sarcos Robotics** — Went public via SPAC 2022; stock collapsed >95%; pivoting to inspection
- **Scaled Robotics** — Limited recent information; may have pivoted or shut down

## Systemic Risks for the Portfolio
1. **Hardware scaling is hard** — Unit economics often don't work until significant scale
2. **Ag cycle downturn** — Farmer capex budgets compressed (hits Carbon, Verdant, Aigen, Deere)
3. **Construction slowdown risk** — Interest rates impact building starts (hits Dusty, Toggle, Built)
4. **Government budget uncertainty** — Defense/infrastructure spending not guaranteed (hits Gecko, Skydio)
5. **Tariff exposure** — Many robots use global supply chains; tariff headwinds for 2026
6. **Competition from big tech** — Google DeepMind, Tesla Optimus, Nvidia Isaac could commoditize robotics AI
7. **Liability/regulatory gaps** — Autonomous operation regulations still evolving; incidents could create backlash
