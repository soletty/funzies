# PART IV: KEY THEMES AND RISK FACTORS

---

## Macro Themes Driving Robotics Investment

1. **Defense Autonomy Imperative:** Ukraine conflict validated autonomous drones and loitering munitions. Every major military is now accelerating autonomous systems procurement. CCA (Collaborative Combat Aircraft) is a $25B+ program.

2. **Surgical Robotics Expansion:** da Vinci 5 cycle, new entrants (Hugo, Ottava), and procedure type expansion (bronchoscopy, orthopedics, spine) are driving the market beyond $15B by 2030.

3. **Regulatory Tailwinds in Defense:** DJI ban, NDAA compliance requirements, and Blue UAS programs benefit US-manufactured drone companies (Skydio, AeroVironment).

4. **Consolidation in Medical Robotics:** Smaller players being acquired (Asensus by KARL STORZ, Memic by Medtronic, Monogram by Zimmer Biomet). Trend likely to continue.

5. **AI Integration:** AI is transforming both sectors -- surgical AI for procedure guidance and analytics; defense AI for autonomous operations and swarming.

## Portfolio-Level Risk Factors

1. **Valuation Risk:** Many robotics companies trade at premium multiples. A rotation away from growth/tech could compress valuations significantly.

2. **Government Budget Risk:** Defense robotics companies are dependent on sustained defense spending growth. Budget sequestration or political shifts could impact.

3. **Regulatory/FDA Risk:** Medical robotics companies face FDA clearance timelines, recall risk, and reimbursement uncertainty.

4. **Private Market Liquidity:** ~30% of recommended portfolio is in private companies with uncertain liquidity timelines.

5. **Competition Risk:** Rapid technological change means today's leaders could be disrupted. Legacy defense primes are investing heavily in autonomous systems.

6. **Geopolitical Risk:** Export controls (ITAR), China tensions, and sanctions regimes affect both sectors.
