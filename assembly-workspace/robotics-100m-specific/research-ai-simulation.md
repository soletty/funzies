# PART 3: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS & PORTFOLIO RECOMMENDATIONS

---

## Tier 1: Highest Conviction (Suggested Allocation: 40-50% of $100M)

| Company | Category | Est. Valuation | Why |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----|
| Physical Intelligence | Foundation Models | $2.4B | Best team in robot AI, reasonable valuation, open-source ecosystem play |
| NVIDIA (NVDA) | Infrastructure | $3.4T (public) | Picks and shovels for entire robotics revolution |
| Agility Robotics | Humanoid/Manipulation | $2.1B | Most commercially deployed humanoid, Amazon relationship |
| Applied Intuition | Simulation | $15B | Real revenue, expandable to robotics simulation |

## Tier 2: Strong Conviction (Suggested Allocation: 25-30%)

| Company | Category | Est. Valuation | Why |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----|
| Apptronik | Humanoid | $3-4B | Strategic investor base (Mercedes, Google, Deere), NASA heritage |
| Dexterity | Manipulation | ~$500M [*] | Real customers (FedEx, GXO), production-focused |
| Skild AI | Foundation Models | $1.5B | CMU team, omni-bodied approach, top-tier investors |
| Foxglove | Infrastructure | ~$100-200M | "Datadog for robotics," early-stage infrastructure play |

## Tier 3: Opportunistic / Watch List (Suggested Allocation: 10-15%)

| Company | Category | Est. Valuation | Why |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----|
| 1X Technologies | Humanoid | ~$1B | OpenAI backing, more reasonable valuation than Figure |
| Sanctuary AI | Humanoid | ~$500M-$1B | Dexterous manipulation focus, world model approach |
| Helm.ai | Synthetic Data | ~$1B | Honda/VW partnerships, transferable tech |
| Formant | Fleet Mgmt | ~$100-200M | Small but essential infrastructure category |
| Collaborative Robotics | Teleop/Data | ~$500M [*] | Ex-Amazon Robotics leadership |

## Companies to AVOID or Approach with Caution

| Company | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Figure AI ($39B) | Valuation too aggressive; limited upside at current price |
| Covariant | Effectively acquired by Amazon; not investable |
| Tesla (for Optimus) | Cannot isolate Optimus exposure from EV/energy business |
| Google DeepMind Robotics | Cannot isolate from Alphabet; researchers may leave |
| Stability AI | Financial instability; not robotics-focused |
| Waabi | Narrowly focused on trucking; Canadian jurisdiction |

## Key Market Themes for 2026-2027

1. **Foundation model consolidation:** Pi, Skild, and Google DeepMind are converging on similar VLA architectures. Expect winners to emerge by 2027.

2. **Humanoid bubble risk:** Combined humanoid valuations exceed $50B with near-zero collective revenue. A correction is possible.

3. **Simulation as bottleneck:** The biggest constraint on robot AI is training data. Companies solving this (NVIDIA, Applied Intuition, Helm.ai) have structural advantages.

4. **Infrastructure picks:** Foxglove, Formant, and ROS 2 ecosystem companies are undervalued relative to the hype around humanoids.

5. **Amazon as kingmaker:** Amazon's acquisition of Covariant talent, investment in Agility, and internal robotics efforts make them the most important customer/competitor in warehouse robotics.

6. **China competition:** Chinese humanoid companies (Unitree, Fourier Intelligence, UBTECH) are entering the market at lower price points. This is under-discussed in Western investment circles.

7. **Enterprise vs. consumer:** The first profitable humanoid deployments will be in industrial/logistics settings, not consumer homes. Figure's pivot to home is risky.
