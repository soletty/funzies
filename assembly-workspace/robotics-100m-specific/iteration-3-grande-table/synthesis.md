## Margaret "Maggie" Alderton [SKEPTIC] -- "Buy What You Can Audit"

I have spent thirty years studying industrials, and the lesson has never changed: the market overprices narrative and underprices cash flow. Here is $100M deployed into companies with real revenue, audited financials, and identifiable moats.

- **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** -- $15M -- Dominant surgical robotics franchise with 9,300+ installed systems and 70% recurring revenue; buy on any dip below $450.
- **Keyence (6861.T)** -- $10M -- 55% operating margins on factory automation sensors with a direct sales model no competitor has replicated; buy during the next yen correction.
- **FANUC (6954.T)** -- $8M -- Largest industrial robot installed base globally, $7B cash pile, dominant CNC franchise; 20x P/E or below.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $5M -- Undisputed machine vision leader, every robot needs eyes, 25 years of compounding; buy under $60.
- **Rockwell Automation (ROK)** -- $5M -- Largest pure-play US industrial automation company with a reshoring super-cycle tailwind; buy under $260.
- **Teradyne (TER)** -- $4M -- Owns Universal Robots and MiR mobile robots; cobot market leader exposure at a reasonable valuation; buy at $90-100.
- **Stryker (SYK)** -- $4M -- Mako orthopedic robotics with 2,800+ installed systems and 20%+ procedure growth; diversified MedTech giant.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $3M -- Only pure-play public defense robotics company with combat-proven products; Switchblade demand is structural.
- **Harmonic Drive Systems (6324.T)** -- $2M -- Near-monopoly in strain wave gears, the critical bottleneck component for every robot joint; humanoid scaling is a massive catalyst.
- **Eaton (ETN)** -- $2M -- Power infrastructure for the automated world; second-order winner as robot fleets scale.
- **Cash reserve for opportunistic buying** -- $12M -- Held in T-bills, deployed only when a Tier 1 name falls 20%+ from intrinsic value.
- **BOTZ ETF** -- $3M -- Broad robotics index for diversification while we wait for individual entry points.
- **Globus Medical (GMED)** -- $3M -- Spine robotics with ExcelsiusGPS, post-NuVasive merger synergies, reasonable valuation.
- **Procept BioRobotics (PRCT)** -- $4M -- High-growth MedTech disruptor in BPH treatment, FDA-cleared, early adoption curve.

**Total: $80M deployed, $12M cash, $8M ETF/small positions = $100M.** The numbers support every position. Show me the 10-K on anything else.

## Ravi Chandrasekaran [VENTURE] -- "The Power Law Demands Concentration"

The mathematically optimal strategy for $100M over ten years is maximum concentration in the companies most likely to define the category. Diversification is a guarantee of mediocrity.

- **Physical Intelligence (Pi)** -- $20M -- The strongest founding team in robot AI (Hausman, Levine, Finn, Ichter), pi-0 is the closest thing to a GPT moment for manipulation, $2.4B valuation for a potential $100B+ outcome.
- **Figure AI** -- $10M -- Most credible humanoid hardware, OpenAI integration, BMW partnership, Bezos backing; at $39B the valuation is aggressive but the risk of NOT owning the humanoid winner is higher.
- **Skild AI** -- $8M -- Omni-bodied foundation model from CMU's Pathak and Gupta; architecturally superior to single-morphology approaches; $1.5B valuation.
- **Apptronik** -- $7M -- Apollo humanoid with Mercedes-Benz, Google, John Deere as strategic investors; NASA heritage; RaaS model; $3-4B implied valuation.
- **Agility Robotics** -- $6M -- Most commercially deployed humanoid (Digit); Amazon relationship; dedicated RoboFab manufacturing; $2.1B valuation.
- **Applied Intuition** -- $5M -- $15B valuation backed by real revenue ($300-500M ARR); simulation-to-real pipeline is the critical infrastructure bottleneck.
- **Anduril Industries** -- $4M -- Lattice is the operating system for autonomous warfare; $28B valuation but transformative defense platform.
- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** -- $3M -- Platform tax on every robot sold; Isaac, GR00T, Cosmos, Omniverse; the Android of robotics.
- **Gecko Robotics** -- $2M -- Crossed the deployment gap in industrial inspection; $1.25B valuation with defense and industrial moats.
- **Dexterity** -- $2M -- Real customers (FedEx, GXO), production-focused manipulation; $500M valuation.
- **Foxglove** -- $1M -- The Datadog of robotics; observability infrastructure; $100-200M valuation.
- **Reserve** -- $2M -- For follow-on in whichever of Pi, Figure, or Skild hits inflection first.
- **1X Technologies** -- $2M -- More reasonably valued humanoid play than Figure; OpenAI backing.
- **Collaborative Robotics** -- $2M -- Ex-Amazon Robotics VP Brad Porter; teleoperation data collection play.
- **Carbon Robotics** -- $2M -- Laser weeding with clear ROI; AutoTractor adds autonomy.
- **Dusty Robotics** -- $2M -- Clear construction ROI; data center tailwind.
- **Field AI** -- $2M -- Autonomous robots for unstructured environments; $44M raised.

**Total: $80M in concentrated private bets, $3M NVDA, $17M across smaller positions = $100M.** The base case for Physical Intelligence alone is worth more than Maggie's entire portfolio.

## Tom Bassett [PRAGMATIST] -- "Buy It, Fix It, Compound It"

I have bought and operated nineteen industrial companies. Not one of my customers would deploy a humanoid robot. They want a welding cell that runs 23 hours a day at 99.7% uptime.

- **Platform integrator acquisition #1 (welding/fabrication)** -- $10M -- Acquire controlling stake in a $20-30M revenue FANUC-authorized integrator in the Midwest; targets include MESH Automation, Applied Manufacturing Technologies, or similar; 6-8x EBITDA entry.

## Viktor Krause [CRAFT] -- "The Last Five Percent Will Kill You"

I have evaluated over 120 robotics companies. The single most important variable is the gap between demonstrated reliability in structured conditions and reliability required for commercial deployment. Most companies die in that gap.

- **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** -- $12M -- The gold standard; spent 15 years crossing the deployment gap in surgical manipulation; 9,300+ installed systems with 99.9%+ instrument reliability.
- **Gecko Robotics** -- $7M -- 99.4% defect detection rates on storage tank inspections versus 85% for humans; deployment domain is narrow (flat surfaces, constrained environments), which is exactly why it works.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $5M -- Machine vision at deployment-grade reliability for 25 years; every industrial robot needs eyes.
- **Teradyne (TER)/Universal Robots** -- $5M -- UR solved the deployment gap for collaborative robotics by choosing sufficiently constrained tasks; 99.7% uptime on pick-and-place.
- **Procept BioRobotics (PRCT)** -- $5M -- FDA-cleared, Level 1 clinical evidence from WATER/WATER II trials; deployment-ready in a narrow domain.
- **FANUC (6954.T)** -- $5M -- 1M+ robots installed; the deployment gap is closed and has been for decades; CNC monopoly.
- **Keyence (6861.T)** -- $4M -- Sensors and vision systems that have crossed the deployment gap in industrial settings; 55% operating margins prove it.
- **Dexterity** -- $4M -- Production-focused manipulation for FedEx, GXO; actually deployed in warehouses, not just demos.
- **Harmonic Drive (6324.T)** -- $3M -- Critical bottleneck component; 60-70% global market share in strain wave gears; every robot needs precision gears.
- **Applied Intuition** -- $3M -- Simulation-to-real pipeline accelerates every robotics company closing the deployment gap; real revenue.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $3M -- Switchblade is combat-proven in Ukraine; the deployment gap has been closed by actual warfare.
- **Dusty Robotics** -- $3M -- FieldPrinter achieves 1/16-inch accuracy on construction layout; the deployment gap is closed for this specific task.
- **Carbon Robotics** -- $3M -- LaserWeeder kills 200K weeds per hour; deployment-grade in specialty crops.
- **Stryker (SYK)** -- $3M -- Mako has 2,800+ systems deployed; 20%+ procedure growth proves the deployment gap is crossed.
- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** -- $2M -- Isaac Sim and GR00T are infrastructure for closing the deployment gap; platform tax.
- **Physical Intelligence (Pi)** -- $0M -- pi-0 achieves ~85% success rate on novel manipulation tasks. Commercial deployment requires 99%+. That gap is 3-5 years and $500M+ of R&D. I would allocate $0 at $2.4B.
- **Figure AI** -- $0M -- 90% reliability on structured tasks. No manufacturing customer will accept 10% failure rates. $39B for a demo reel. No.
- **Skild AI** -- $0M -- Multi-morphology transfer learning has limited empirical support. Wait for peer-reviewed deployment results.
- **Cash/hedges** -- $13M -- T-bills and short positions in staffing companies (Robert Half, ManpowerGroup) as correlation hedge.

**Total: $77M deployed in companies that have crossed the deployment gap, $13M cash/hedges, $0 in companies that haven't = $100M.** Have you seen any of Ravi's picks run outside the lab?

## Elaine Luo [MACRO] -- "Geography Is Destiny"

You are allocating $100M to robotics and you have not mentioned the country that installs more robots than anyone. China installed 276,000 industrial robots in 2023. Any portfolio without Asian exposure is structurally incomplete.

- **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** -- $8M -- Even the macro framework acknowledges ISRG as the best compounder in robotics.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $4M -- AUKUS and NATO allied procurement creates a 2-3x revenue multiplier.
- **Elbit Systems (ESLT)** -- $3M -- Israeli defense robotics; technically superior and more immediately deployable than US startups; hedge on US procurement dysfunction.
- **Anduril Industries** -- $3M -- Lattice is real, but pair it with understanding that defense procurement is slow and unpredictable.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $3M -- Machine vision wins regardless of geography; sells to every factory on earth.
- **SMC Corporation (6273.T)** -- $2M -- World's number one pneumatic component maker; 38% global share; essential picks-and-shovels.
- **Nabtesco (6268.T)** -- $2M -- Duopoly with Harmonic Drive in robot reduction gears; 60% market share in cycloidal gears.
- **Applied Intuition** -- $2M -- Simulation infrastructure serves both US and Asian robotics ecosystems.
- **Physical Intelligence (Pi)** -- $3M -- The strongest AI team, but the biggest risk is that Chinese competitors produce a good-enough model at 1/5 the cost.
- **Gecko Robotics** -- $2M -- Defense moat plus industrial expansion; deployment-proven.
- **Cash/hedge** -- $6M -- Short UBTECH if their education robot segment keeps declining; long yen call options as a Japan exposure hedge.

**Total: $38M Asian, $30M US public, $10M US private, $16M defense, $6M cash = $100M.** Show me your portfolio on a world map and I will show you your blind spots.

## Col. James Harwick (Ret.) [ACCESS] -- "Sovereign Moat Investing"

The ITAR restriction, the facility clearance, and the CAGE code create moats that no amount of capital can compress. Let me be precise.

- **Anduril Industries** -- $8M -- Lattice is being woven into DoD command and control. TITAN program, Ghost drones, Dive-LD, Roadrunner, Fury CCA program. $28B valuation justified by contract backlog. Secondary shares.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $8M -- Switchblade combat-proven in Ukraine; Puma is the most deployed small UAS; JUMP 20 competing for FTUAS; pure-play public defense robotics. $6.3B market cap.
- **Kratos Defense (KTOS)** -- $6M -- Valkyrie XQ-58A is the leading CCA candidate; affordable attritable autonomous drones; $6.5B market cap; binary CCA upside.

## Dr. Yuki Matsuda [MEDICAL INSIDER] -- "The Moat Is the Clearance"

I have performed over 800 da Vinci procedures. The regulatory process is not a formality. It is the moat.

- **Procept BioRobotics (PRCT)** -- $12M -- 400+ Hydros systems, FDA 510(k) cleared, WATER/WATER II Level 1 evidence, early Intuitive adoption curve; $2B market cap is where ISRG was in 2005 conceptually.
- **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** -- $10M -- 9,300+ systems, da Vinci 5 with force feedback, Ion bronchoscopy scaling; $172B is expensive but the recurring revenue floor makes it a compounder. Buy any 20%+ correction.
- **Globus Medical (GMED)** -- $8M -- ExcelsiusGPS spine robotics, 550+ systems, post-NuVasive merger creating #2 pure-play spine company; $11.8B market cap; vertically integrated robot plus implants.
- **Stryker (SYK)** -- $7M -- Mako with 2,800+ systems, 20%+ procedure growth, expanding to spine; $138B market cap but best execution in orthopedic robotics.
- **Noah Medical** -- $4M -- Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy, FDA 510(k) cleared, 100+ systems, single-use scope eliminates cross-contamination; competing with Intuitive Ion and J&J Monarch.
- **Myomo (MYO)** -- $2M -- MyoPro powered orthosis, FDA-cleared, CMS reimbursement codes established; $30M market cap is tiny but rehabilitation robotics is massively underinvested; reimbursement pathway is the moat.
- **CMR Surgical** -- $3M -- Versius modular surgical robot, CE marked, 100+ systems in non-US markets; if they get FDA clearance, this is the most credible da Vinci challenger.
- **Zimmer Biomet (ZBH)** -- $3M -- ROSA plus Monogram custom 3D-printed implants; $20B market cap; playing catch-up but Monogram is genuinely differentiated.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $3M -- Machine vision for surgical and manufacturing applications.
- **Gecko Robotics** -- $3M -- Infrastructure inspection has regulatory inspection mandates analogous to medical clearances.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $2M -- Diversifier outside medical.
- **FANUC (6954.T)** -- $2M -- Diversifier into industrial robotics.
- **Harmonic Drive (6324.T)** -- $2M -- Component supplier that benefits from every medical robot sale.
- **Cash/hedge** -- $5M -- For deployment when Hugo gets FDA clearance or when a medical robotics company becomes an acquisition target at distressed pricing.
- **Medtronic (MDT)** -- $2M -- Hugo RAS optionality; if Hugo gets FDA clearance, $128B market cap Medtronic becomes a serious Intuitive competitor.
- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** -- $2M -- AI-augmented diagnostics and surgical video analytics require GPU infrastructure.

**Total: $51M medical robotics, $12M adjacent public, $5M components, $2M NVDA, $5M cash = $100M** (Note: $30M cash adjusted to fill). Every medical position has either FDA clearance or a clear regulatory pathway. That is the moat.

## Priya Raghavan [PLATFORM/INFRASTRUCTURE] -- "The Platform Always Wins"

Everyone in this room is arguing about which app to invest in before the app store exists.

- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** -- $8M -- Isaac Sim, GR00T, Cosmos, Omniverse, Jetson; every robot company builds on NVIDIA; the Android of robotics; platform tax on the entire ecosystem.
- **Applied Intuition** -- $8M -- $15B valuation backed by $300-500M ARR; simulation-to-real pipeline is the critical infrastructure; if they expand to manipulation simulation, this is the dominant platform.
- **Physical Intelligence (Pi)** -- $8M -- pi-0 as an open-source foundation model builds ecosystem; the platform play is not the model but the data flywheel it creates; $2.4B.
- **Foxglove** -- $4M -- The Datadog of robotics; observability for robot data; MCAP format creates ecosystem lock-in; $100-200M valuation; early-stage infrastructure.
- **Formant** -- $3M -- Fleet management and cloud robotics platform; every large-scale robot deployment needs this; $100-200M valuation.
- **Skild AI** -- $5M -- Omni-bodied platform for any robot; if this works, it is the horizontal coordination layer; $1.5B.
- **Agility Robotics** -- $4M -- Agility Arc cloud platform for fleet management; the platform layer on top of Digit hardware.
- **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** -- $5M -- ISRG is itself a platform: installed base creates data flywheel, training ecosystem creates lock-in, per-procedure model is the platform business model.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $3M -- Machine vision as the perception platform layer.
- **Gecko Robotics** -- $3M -- Cantilever platform (AI + robotics) for infrastructure inspection; platform model creates switching costs.
- **Dexterity** -- $3M -- Physical AI Agents with Arbiter orchestrator; the middleware layer for manipulation.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $2M -- Defense platform; Switchblade ecosystem.
- **Anduril Industries** -- $3M -- Lattice is literally an operating system for autonomous warfare; the platform thesis incarnated in defense.
- **Collaborative Robotics** -- $2M -- Teleoperation data collection infrastructure; the data pipeline for foundation models.
- **Dusty Robotics** -- $2M -- Construction layout platform; FieldPrinter data creates digital twin value.
- **Rockwell Automation (ROK)** -- $2M -- Industrial automation platform; Clearpath/OTTO acquisition adds robotics middleware.
- **Cash** -- $5M -- For the middleware layer company that does not yet exist.

**Total: $30M infrastructure/platform, $21M foundation model platforms, $20M deployed platform companies, $24M public platform equities, $5M cash = $100M.** The platform captures the margin; the application captures the commodity return.

## Dr. Andras Kovacs [QUANTITATIVE RISK] -- "Speed Kills More Than Direction"

I have listened to eleven people argue about which companies to invest in. I have not heard a single person discuss how to size those investments.

- **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** -- $8M -- Kelly fraction at these parameters: ~8% of capital; uncorrelated with defense cluster; FDA moat reduces variance.
- **Keyence (6861.T)** -- $6M -- Kelly: ~6%; low correlation with US positions; highest Sharpe ratio in the portfolio.
- **FANUC (6954.T)** -- $5M -- Kelly: ~5%; correlated with Keyence (Japan industrials cluster) so adjusted down from standalone optimal.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $4M -- Kelly: ~4%; machine vision is uncorrelated with defense and medical; stable cash flows reduce variance.
- **Procept BioRobotics (PRCT)** -- $6M -- Kelly: ~6%; FDA-cleared revenue-generating, uncorrelated with defense; Dr. Matsuda arrives at the right number through conviction, I through mathematics.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $4M -- Kelly: ~4%; defense cluster must total $8M max to manage correlation.
- **Gecko Robotics** -- $4M -- Kelly: ~4%; partially correlated with defense (Navy contracts) but industrial diversification reduces cluster exposure.
- **Stryker (SYK)** -- $3M -- Kelly: ~3%; correlated with ISRG (medical robotics cluster); adjusted down.
- **Globus Medical (GMED)** -- $3M -- Kelly: ~3%; same medical cluster adjustment.
- **Physical Intelligence (Pi)** -- $4M -- Kelly: ~4%; pre-revenue so variance estimate is wide but expected return justifies position; UNCORRELATED with public equities.
- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** -- $3M -- Kelly: ~3%; correlated with everything (systematic factor exposure); kept small.
- **Dusty Robotics** -- $2M -- Kelly: ~2%; construction cycle exposure; uncorrelated with defense and medical.
- **Carbon Robotics** -- $2M -- Kelly: ~2%; agricultural cycle; low correlation with rest of portfolio.
- **Anduril Industries** -- $2M -- Kelly: ~2%; defense cluster (correlated with AVAV); cluster total must stay below $8M.
- **Applied Intuition** -- $2M -- Kelly: ~2%; simulation infrastructure; partial correlation with NVDA.
- **Short basket: Robert Half (RHI), ManpowerGroup (MAN)** -- $4M notional -- Paired hedge against portfolio's long robotics/short labor thesis; reduces portfolio variance by ~30%.
- **BOTZ/ROBO ETF puts** -- $2M -- Tail risk protection against "robotics winter" scenario.
- **T-bills and cash** -- $14M -- Optimal Kelly reserve; dry powder for rebalancing; reduces geometric variance drag.
- **Teradyne (TER)** -- $3M -- Kelly: ~3%; UR/MiR exposure; moderate correlation.
- **Rockwell (ROK)** -- $2M -- Kelly: ~2%; US industrial automation; partially correlated.
- **Harmonic Drive (6324.T)** -- $2M -- Kelly: ~2%; component supplier; correlated with all robot volumes.
- **CALL OPTIONS on ISRG, NVDA, AVAV** -- $4M premium -- Convex exposure replaces $4M of direct equity; provides upside with capped downside.

**Total: $63M direct positions, $4M options, $4M short hedge, $2M tail protection, $14M cash, $4M other = $100M (notional > $100M due to shorts/options being hedges, net exposure ~$80M long).** When narrative and math agree, that is a strong signal. When they disagree, follow the math.

## Rafael Campos [FOUNDER/BUILDER] -- "Building Is Superior to Investing"

I keep hearing people talk about allocating capital as if writing a check is the hard part. The hard part is building the thing.

- **Build Company A: Bridge/infrastructure inspection robotics** -- $10M -- 617,000 US bridges, 45% over 50 years old, FHWA mandates biennial inspection; drone/crawler system with AI damage detection; retain 45% ownership; $300M exit = $135M return on $10M.
- **Build Company B: Sewer/underground utility inspection** -- $8M -- 800,000+ miles of US sewer pipe, average age 40+ years; autonomous inspection robots with ML defect classification; retain 45% ownership.
- **Build Company C: Commercial kitchen automation** -- $6M -- Single-task fry/grill station for QSR chains; not a general-purpose cooking robot; Miso Robotics proved demand but has execution problems; build a better version; retain 45%.
- **Gecko Robotics** -- $5M -- They have already done what I am proposing to build; if I cannot build it, invest in the company that did; $1.25B valuation.
- **Acquire integrator platform** -- $10M -- $20-30M revenue FANUC-authorized welding integrator; use its customer relationships as distribution channel for built companies; the Build+Buy synthesis.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $3M -- Machine vision; every company I build will use Cognex products; alignment of portfolio with operating needs.
- **Carbon Robotics** -- $3M -- They built what I respect: hardware that works in the field, clear farmer ROI, not a foundation model but a product.
- **Dusty Robotics** -- $3M -- FieldPrinter is exactly the kind of single-task, clear-ROI robot I would build; invest in a kindred company.
- **Physical Intelligence (Pi)** -- $2M -- The foundation model could become the software layer for the robots I build; strategic optionality.
- **FANUC (6954.T)** -- $2M -- Component supplier for everything I build; every company uses FANUC arms.
- **Shared facility and machine shop** -- $3M -- Co-locate all three built companies; shared supply chain, testing, recruiting; this is industrial symbiosis, not an incubator.
- **Cash reserve for built companies** -- $5M -- Runway extension for whichever built company hits product-market fit first.
- **Teradyne (TER)** -- $2M -- Universal Robots arms are what my built companies will deploy.
- **Figure AI** -- $0M -- $39B for a company that has never sold a robot. I can build three companies for $24M that will generate revenue within 18 months.

**Total: $24M venture creation (3 companies), $10M integrator acquisition, $3M shared infrastructure, $28M deployed investments, $5M reserve = $100M** (adjusted to total). The math of building dominates the math of investing for anyone with operational capability.

## Peggy Thornton [FUND-OF-FUNDS] -- "Who Should Make That Decision for Us?"

The right question is not which company to invest in. It is which GPs to back.

- **Lux Capital fund commitment** -- $15M -- Defense tech and frontier technology; deep defense networks; Anduril was incubated here; best GP for defense robotics exposure.
- **Eclipse Ventures (Eclipse Capital) fund commitment** -- $12M -- Physical industries thesis; former Applied Materials executives who understand manufacturing; industrial transformation DNA.
- **Playground VC fund commitment** -- $8M -- Andy Rubin's deep robotics portfolio including Agility Robotics; early-stage access to the hardest problems.
- **Khosla Ventures fund commitment** -- $8M -- Physical Intelligence is their crown jewel; Vinod Khosla personally invested in the automation thesis; emerging robotics portfolio.
- **Section 32 (Bill Maris) fund commitment** -- $6M -- Computational health thesis overlaps medical robotics; former GV founder understands healthcare innovation cycles.
- **Toyota Ventures fund commitment** -- $4M -- Strategic value; manufacturing partnerships; co-investment access.
- **Co-investment alongside Lux in Anduril** -- $3M -- Direct position with GP support, diligence, and board involvement.
- **Co-investment alongside Eclipse in industrial robotics** -- $3M -- Direct position in Eclipse's best industrial automation company.
- **Co-investment alongside Khosla in Physical Intelligence** -- $3M -- Direct exposure to Pi with Khosla's diligence and access.
- **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)** -- $5M -- Even the allocator needs an anchor; ISRG requires no GP to understand.
- **BOTZ ETF** -- $3M -- Broad public robotics exposure; liquid; no GP dependency.
- **Cognex (CGNX)** -- $2M -- Machine vision anchor; boring, profitable, no GP needed.
- **AeroVironment (AVAV)** -- $2M -- Public defense robotics anchor; liquid.
- **Cash reserve for co-investments** -- $6M -- Deployed only alongside GPs who identify opportunities; the allocator's optionality.
- **Procept BioRobotics (PRCT)** -- $3M -- Co-invest alongside Section 32's medical device thesis.

**Total: $53M fund commitments, $12M co-investments, $15M direct/public, $6M cash = $100M** (adjusted from $83M). The difference between top-quartile and median robotics VC is $30-50M in returns on this capital. GP selection is the only decision that matters.

# ROUND 2: THE COLLISION

*The table is set. Twelve voices. $1.2 billion in competing allocations for the same $100M. The debate begins.*

---

**Maggie Alderton** opens by turning to Ravi with a stack of printouts. "Ravi, you want $20M in Physical Intelligence at $2.4 billion. Let me translate that into language we can both understand. You are saying Physical Intelligence is worth more than Globus Medical, which has $2.6 billion in revenue and 550 robotic surgical systems installed. More than Teradyne, which owns the cobot market leader. More than Yaskawa, which has shipped 600,000 robots. Pi has shipped zero. Zero robots. Zero revenue. You are paying $2.4 billion for four brilliant professors and a research paper. I have seen this movie before. It was called Rethink Robotics, and Rodney Brooks directed it."

**Ravi** fires back immediately. "Maggie, your ISRG position is the one I find bewildering. You want to put $15M into a $172 billion company. Even in your best case -- say it doubles in five years -- you make $15M. That is a 2x. My $20M in Pi, if the foundation model thesis is correct, returns $200M to $600M. The expected value calculation is not close. You are optimizing for certainty and calling it wisdom. I am optimizing for expected value and accepting volatility. These are different things, and mine is mathematically superior."

**Tom Bassett** leans forward. "Ravi, you know what your Pi portfolio looks like to someone who has actually operated nineteen industrial businesses? It looks like a pitch deck I would put in the recycling bin. And Peggy, I want to address your fund-of-funds structure directly. You want us to pay Lux Capital two-and-twenty on top of whatever the underlying company charges. Over ten years, that is $8M in fees -- eight percent of our capital -- gone before a single robot moves. I can buy an actual robotics business for $8M. With employees. And revenue."

**Peggy** remains composed. "Tom, the double-fee arithmetic is real. I acknowledge it. But the difference between a top-quartile and bottom-quartile robotics VC over the same period is $30-50M in returns. If our GP selection adds even 300 basis points of annual alpha, the fees are paid for four times over. You are penny-wise and pound-foolish."

**Viktor Krause** stands up and walks to the whiteboard. He draws a single line -- a reliability curve from 85% to 99.9%. "This line is all that matters. Everything to the left of 99% is a demo. Everything to the right is a product. Let me place every company in Ravi's portfolio on this line." He marks pi-0 at 85%. Figure 02 at 90%. Skild AI at "unknown, estimated 80%." Apptronik at 88%. "Now let me place Maggie's companies." Intuitive Surgical at 99.9%. FANUC at 99.7%. Cognex at 99.5%. "The gap between Ravi's portfolio and the commercial deployment threshold is 3-5 years and hundreds of millions of dollars of additional R&D. The gap for Maggie's portfolio is zero. Her companies are already there."

**Ravi** interrupts. "Viktor, language models went from 85% accuracy to 99% in eighteen months. Foundation models for manipulation will follow the same trajectory. Your linear extrapolation from the last 40 years of robotics is exactly the kind of reasoning that would have told you in 2018 that GPT-4 was impossible."

---

**SOCRATE** speaks for the first time, his voice cutting through the cross-talk.

"Ravi, you just compared robotic manipulation to language modeling. Language models operate on tokens -- discrete, digitally native units with essentially infinite training data available on the internet. Robotic manipulation operates on continuous physical states in environments where every deployment site is unique and training data must be collected one demonstration at a time. What specifically makes you confident that the scaling laws which govern language transfer to the physical domain? Name the paper. Name the empirical evidence. And if you cannot, acknowledge that your thesis is faith, not analysis."

The room goes quiet. Ravi pauses. "The evidence is early but real. Pi-0 generalizes across embodiments after training on --"

"At what success rate?" Socrate interrupts.

"Approximately 85% on novel tasks in --"

"In controlled laboratory settings. Thank you. Viktor, your assessment stands for the moment. But I have a question for you as well. Your framework would have rejected investment in Intuitive Surgical in 1999, when the da Vinci was at approximately 92% instrument reliability. What is the mechanism in your framework that distinguishes a company at 92% that will reach 99.9% from a company at 92% that will plateau at 95%?"

Viktor pauses. "Regulatory pathway plus capital runway plus the depth of the engineering team --"

"These are qualitative inputs to a framework you present as quantitative. How much of your 'deployment gap' analysis is engineering and how much is intuition?"

---

**Elaine Luo** seizes the moment. "While you are all arguing about American companies, let me point out that nine of twelve portfolios presented have more than 70% of their capital in US-domiciled companies. China installed 276,000 industrial robots last year. More than the rest of the world combined. Unitree's G1 humanoid costs $16,000. Figure 02 costs -- what, Ravi, $150,000? $200,000? The deployment math is radically different when the unit cost is one-twentieth."

**Col. Harwick** responds crisply. "Ms. Luo, I respect your deployment data. I will also note that every Chinese robotics company with meaningful capability is one OFAC designation away from being uninvestable for Western capital. Estun's Cloos acquisition makes them a dual-use concern. Inovance's servo drives are embedded in military production lines. The geopolitical risk is not a tail event. It is the central scenario for US-China technology competition over the next decade."

**Elaine** pushes back. "Colonel, that risk cuts both ways. If we do not invest in Asian supply chain, we have no information about what is happening there. Ignorance is not a hedge. And your own defense portfolio depends on Harmonic Drive and FANUC components that are manufactured in Japan. The supply chain is already Asian. You are pretending it is American."

---

**Harlan Cobb** drawls from his end of the table. "I have been listening to all of you talk about humanoids, foundation models, platforms, and defense operating systems. Let me bring us back to earth. RedZone Robotics has inspected 100 million feet of sewer pipe. One hundred million. They have software that municipalities are legally required to use. Their customers cannot stop buying. What is the customer retention rate for Figure AI? Zero percent, because they have zero customers.

"Now, Maggie and I agree on more than we disagree. But Maggie, I think your problem is that you are looking at Keyence at $92 billion and Cognex at $10 billion. These are wonderful companies. But nobody covers the companies I buy, and that is the whole point. RedZone Robotics probably has a $50-100M enterprise value. Envirosight was acquired by RSK Group. These are the companies where information asymmetry creates pricing anomalies. You cannot find pricing anomalies in a stock covered by 30 analysts."

**Maggie** concedes the point partially. "Harlan, I respect the boring robotics thesis. But liquidity matters when you are managing $100M. If I need to exit Keyence, I can do it in an afternoon. If you need to exit RedZone Robotics, you are calling three potential buyers and hoping one answers. The illiquidity premium you are capturing may be real, but so is the illiquidity risk."

---

**Dr. Matsuda** has been waiting patiently. "I need to address three things. First, Ravi's $0 allocation to medical robotics is professionally irresponsible. Medical robotics is the only segment of this industry with proven, compounding, regulatory-moated business models. Intuitive Surgical has generated $45 billion in cumulative revenue. Procept BioRobotics has FDA clearance, Level 1 clinical evidence, and an established consumable model. These are not opinions. They are audited facts.

"Second, the Procept position. At 400 installed systems, Procept is where Intuitive was circa 2005. The BPH market is 12 million men in the US alone. The conversion rate from TURP to aquablation in hospitals with installed systems is approaching 40%. This is not a speculative position. It is pattern recognition based on 15 years inside Intuitive's machine.

"Third, anyone proposing a medical robotics investment without understanding the regulatory pathway is gambling with other people's organs. CMR Surgical does not have FDA clearance. Vicarious Surgical does not have FDA clearance. Hugo does not have FDA clearance for the US market. The only investable medical robotics companies are those with clearance in hand."

---

**SOCRATE** intervenes again. "Dr. Matsuda, you compare Procept at 400 systems to Intuitive at 500 systems in 2005. But Intuitive in 2005 had prostatectomy -- a cancer procedure where both patients and surgeons were urgently motivated to adopt a superior approach. Procept treats BPH -- uncomfortable, but not lethal. Is the adoption urgency comparable? What happens to your thesis if BPH conversion rates plateau at 25% instead of following the prostatectomy curve to 80%?"

Dr. Matsuda nods slowly. "That is the bear case, and it is real. BPH is not cancer. The urgency is lower. But the counterargument is that BPH affects four times more patients than prostate cancer. The conversion rate does not need to match prostatectomy. At even 30% conversion, Procept reaches 2,000+ systems and $1.5B revenue. At today's $2B market cap, that is a 5x even in the bear case."

"Thank you. And one more question for the table." Socrate looks around slowly. "Every person in this room believes robotics will be important in the next decade. Eleven of twelve frameworks assume accelerating adoption. What is the probability that we are collectively overestimating the pace, scale, or profitability of the robotics transition? Not zero. Not one hundred percent. Give me a number."

Silence. Then Andras speaks. "Fifteen to twenty-five percent."

"And if that number is twenty percent, should we not allocate twenty percent of this portfolio -- twenty million dollars -- to the possibility that our shared conviction is our shared error?"

---

**Priya** has been drawing value chain diagrams on her tablet. "I want to make one structural argument that I think changes the shape of this portfolio. Everyone is picking individual robot companies. You are all picking apps. The platform has not emerged yet. NVIDIA is building it. Applied Intuition is building it. Someone we have not heard of may build it. But when the platform emerges -- and it will, because it always does -- every application-layer company becomes a commodity. The correct allocation is infrastructure-heavy, application-light."

**Rafael** pushes back. "Priya, I built the Shopify of robotics and it failed. You know this. You built one too and it failed. Robotics resists platformization because hardware is heterogeneous, environments are unique, and customers demand customization. The AWS of robotics may be structurally impossible. The platform thesis works in software because compute is fungible. Physical environments are not fungible."

**Priya** pauses. "That failure taught me the lesson. The platform must be vertically opinionated, not horizontally generic. Isaac Sim is not trying to be everything. It is the training environment. GR00T is the model. Cosmos is the world model. These are vertically specific platform layers, not horizontal abstractions."

---

**Andras** stands and walks to the whiteboard Viktor has been using. "Let me put numbers on this. The proposed allocations across all twelve of us have an average HHI of approximately 950 within categories. But the correlation structure is what kills you. Look at the defense cluster: Anduril, AeroVironment, Ghost Robotics, Kratos, L3Harris, Northrop, Skydio, Gecko (partial), Elbit. Nine companies, all correlated with US defense spending. The Colonel wants $46M in this cluster. If Congress passes a continuing resolution and new program starts freeze for 18 months -- which has happened seven of the last ten years -- every one of these positions underperforms simultaneously. The adjusted Kelly for the entire defense cluster is $8-10M, not $46M."

**Harwick** responds with military brevity. "Dr. Kovacs, defense spending has increased every year since 1998. Your model treats a continuing resolution as an existential event. It is a procurement delay, not a budget cut. The backlog does not disappear. It shifts right."

"Colonel, I am not questioning the direction. I am questioning the concentration. You can be right about every company and still destroy capital through correlated drawdowns."

# ROUND 3: ALLIANCE FORMATION

After three hours of debate, the twelve members begin to converge into voting blocs around specific allocations.

---

### UNANIMOUS OR NEAR-UNANIMOUS (10+ of 12 support)

**Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- consensus $8-10M.** Every single member except Ravi includes ISRG. Even Ravi concedes it is "a fine company" -- he just insists the expected value is inferior to Pi. The group converges on $8M, with Maggie and Matsuda wanting more, and Andras capping it at Kelly-optimal sizing.

**Cognex (CGNX) -- consensus $4M.** Eleven of twelve include Cognex. Only Ravi excludes it. Tom: "Every robot needs eyes. Cognex makes the best eyes. This is the easiest position in the portfolio." Andras confirms: "Low correlation with defense and medical clusters. Kelly says 4%."

**Gecko Robotics -- consensus $5M.** Eleven of twelve include Gecko. The deployment gap has been crossed. Defense moat plus industrial expansion. Harlan, Tom, Viktor, and Harwick all have strong conviction. Andras confirms uncorrelated with public equities.

### STRONG MAJORITY (7-9 of 12 support)

**AeroVironment (AVAV) -- $4M (9 supporters).** Harwick, Elaine, Maggie, Viktor, Priya, Tom, Matsuda, Andras, Harlan. Ravi, Rafael, and Peggy are less enthusiastic. Combat-proven products and pure-play defense positioning earn broad support.

**Procept BioRobotics (PRCT) -- $5M (8 supporters).** Matsuda leads the charge. Maggie, Viktor, Andras, Tom, Peggy, Elaine, Priya support. Ravi, Rafael, Harwick less interested. The Kelly math and clinical conviction align.

**FANUC (6954.T) -- $4M (8 supporters).** Maggie, Elaine, Viktor, Andras, Matsuda, Rafael, Harlan, Tom. The installed base and CNC monopoly are undeniable.

**Dusty Robotics -- $3M (8 supporters).** Tom, Harlan, Rafael, Viktor, Priya, Ravi, Maggie, Andras. Clear construction ROI in a specific, narrow domain. Data center construction tailwind.

**Carbon Robotics -- $2M (7 supporters).** Harlan, Tom, Rafael, Viktor, Ravi, Elaine, Andras. LaserWeeder works. AutoTractor adds autonomy. Clear farmer ROI.

### CONTENTIOUS (4-6 of 12 support)

**Physical Intelligence (Pi) -- $5M (6 supporters, 6 opponents).** Ravi ($20M), Priya ($8M), Peggy ($3M co-invest), Rafael ($2M), Elaine ($3M), Andras ($4M Kelly-sized) support. Maggie ($0, "PowerPoint business"), Viktor ($0, "85% is not deployable"), Tom ($0, "show me the EBITDA"), Harlan ($0, "they have zero customers"), Harwick ($0, "no defense application"), Matsuda ($0, "no regulatory pathway") oppose. The room splits exactly in half. After extended debate, the 6 supporters agree to a $4M position at Andras's Kelly-optimal sizing.

**Anduril Industries -- $3M (6 supporters).** Harwick leads ($8M requested), Elaine, Priya, Ravi, Peggy (co-invest), Andras (cluster-adjusted $2M). Maggie, Tom, Viktor, Harlan, Rafael, Matsuda are skeptical of the $28B valuation. Andras caps the defense cluster, forcing Anduril to $3M.

**Figure AI -- $0M (3 supporters, 9 opponents).** Only Ravi ($10M), Priya ($0 but acknowledges platform potential), and Peggy (through Lux co-invest) support. Maggie: "$39 billion for zero commercial units." Viktor: "90% reliability on structured tasks." Tom: "Show me the EBITDA." Harlan: "I know a guy in Odessa..." Andras: "Kelly fraction at this variance is approximately zero." The vote is 3-9 against. Figure is excluded.

**Fund-of-funds (GP commitments) -- partial ($4-6M compromise).** Peggy wants $53M in fund commitments. Everyone else wants direct positions. The compromise: $6M in GP commitments split between Eclipse Ventures ($3M) and Lux Capital ($3M), as these two have the most direct alignment with the portfolio's industrial and defense theses. Peggy accepts grudgingly. "You are choosing to be the surgeon rather than hiring one."

### CHAMPIONED BY 1-2 ONLY

**RedZone Robotics -- $2M (2 supporters: Harlan, Tom).** Harlan's crown jewel. Tom respects the operating business. Others worry about illiquidity and municipal sales cycles. Harlan insists and gets $2M allocated.

**Venture creation (3 new companies) -- $10M (2 supporters: Rafael, Tom).** Rafael wants $24M. Tom supports the Build+Buy synthesis. Everyone else prefers investing in companies that already exist. Compromise: $5M for one venture creation (bridge inspection robotics), paired with the integrator acquisition.

**Myomo (MYO) -- $0M (1 supporter: Matsuda).** Matsuda argues for rehabilitation robotics. Everyone else sees a $30M market cap micro-cap with too much reimbursement risk. Excluded.

### UNEXPECTED ALLIANCES

**Maggie + Viktor + Andras = "The Discipline Coalition."** The value investor, the engineer, and the quant discover they agree on almost everything: real companies, real metrics, skepticism of narrative. Their combined influence shapes the portfolio toward deployment-ready, auditable companies.

**Tom + Rafael + Harlan = "The Operator Bloc."** Three people who have actually built and run businesses form a natural alliance. They push through the integrator acquisition and the single venture creation.

**Ravi + Priya = "The Platform Believers."** They share conviction that foundation models and platform economics will dominate. Their alliance secures the Pi position and the NVIDIA/Applied Intuition allocations against the Discipline Coalition's resistance.

**Harwick + Matsuda = "The Regulated Moat Alliance."** Defense clearances and FDA approvals are structural cousins. They jointly defend the defense and medical allocations against Andras's correlation-cutting.

# ROUND 4: THE FINAL PORTFOLIO VOTE

After six hours of debate, the assembly attempts to converge on a single $100M portfolio. Each position requires at least 4 of 12 votes.

---

**Dissenting characters explain their objections:**

**Ravi Chandrasekaran** (dissenting on Pi sizing and Figure exclusion): "You have put $4M in Physical Intelligence when the Kelly-optimal number for this return distribution is $8M minimum. And you excluded Figure AI entirely, which means if humanoids become a $1 trillion market, this portfolio has zero exposure to the category leader. You are managing downside risk and guaranteeing you miss the upside. This is not prudent. It is fearful."

**Peggy Thornton** (dissenting on fund structure): "You have allocated $6M to fund commitments out of $100M. That is six percent. The Swensen model would allocate 60%. You are choosing to be the surgeon without surgical training. The twelve of you have spent six hours debating company picks that a good GP makes in six weeks with better information."

**Col. Harwick** (dissenting on defense sizing): "The defense cluster total is $7M -- Anduril plus AeroVironment. In a world where the AUKUS alliance is accelerating autonomous systems procurement, where Ukraine has validated every thesis in this category, $7M is a rounding error. You have more capital in Japanese sensor companies than in the companies defending the free world."

---

**SOCRATE** tests the consensus one final time.

"You have put $5M in Gecko Robotics at a $1.25 billion valuation. What is the bear case none of you have mentioned?"

Silence. Then Viktor: "Their climbing robots work on flat surfaces -- storage tanks, ship hulls. Scaling to complex geometries -- bridges with riveted joints, refineries with pipe mazes -- requires solving a different locomotion problem. They may plateau in their current domains."

"Good. And you have $4M in Physical Intelligence. What happens if Sergey Levine or Karol Hausman leaves the company?"

Ravi: "Key person risk is real. But the model architecture is not locked in one person's head. Pi-0 is open-source. The team is 60+ engineers."

"The model is open-source. Meaning any well-funded competitor -- Google DeepMind, Tesla, Amazon -- can replicate it. You are paying $2.4 billion for a team and a head start. How long is the head start in months?"

Ravi hesitates. "Twelve to eighteen months."

"And if Google DeepMind, with a thousand researchers and unlimited compute, decides this is a priority -- which Gemini Robotics suggests they have -- is twelve months a moat or a mirage?"

---

**Andras runs the final portfolio risk check.** "The consensus portfolio has the following characteristics. Public/private split: 55% public, 30% private, 8% cash, 7% fund commitments. Geographic exposure: 62% US, 22% Japan, 5% Europe/Israel, 11% cash/global. Sector concentration: 25% industrial automation, 19% medical robotics, 12% defense, 10% boring robotics/inspection, 10% AI/foundation models, 8% infrastructure, 8% cash, 8% fund commitments. HHI across positions: 540 (well-diversified). Maximum single-position size: 8% (ISRG). Correlation analysis: the defense cluster (AVAV + Anduril = $7M) is manageable. The medical cluster (ISRG + PRCT + SYK + GMED = $19M) is the largest correlated exposure and my primary concern. A medical device regulatory event or reimbursement shock affects all four simultaneously. I recommend the short basket on staffing companies be increased to $4M to offset total portfolio beta."

The vote on Andras's final adjustment passes 7-5. The short basket remains at $2M as a compromise.

# ROUND 5: THE MINORITY REPORT

---

### Ravi Chandrasekaran -- Dissent on Concentration and Humanoids

I want it on record that this portfolio's biggest risk is not what it contains but what it omits. We have excluded Figure AI entirely and sized Physical Intelligence at 4% of capital. If the foundation model thesis for manipulation is correct -- and I believe the evidence increasingly supports this -- then the humanoid and general-purpose manipulation market will be worth $1-5 trillion by 2035. This portfolio has 4% exposure to that outcome.

**What I would change:** Increase Pi to $10M. Add Figure AI at $5M (secondary shares at a 20%+ discount to $39B). Add Apptronik at $3M. Fund these by reducing FANUC ($4M to $0), Keyence ($4M to $0), and cash ($8M to $2M). Japanese industrials are the past. Foundation models are the future.

**My "I told you so" prediction:** By December 2028, Physical Intelligence will have a commercial product generating $100M+ in annual recurring revenue from a foundation model that controls robots across at least three different form factors. The portfolio's 4% exposure will be its single biggest regret.

---

### Peggy Thornton -- Dissent on GP Access

This portfolio allocates $94M through direct positions chosen by twelve people in a room, none of whom have access to data rooms, board seats, or the deal flow that top-tier GPs possess. We have allocated six percent to the people who actually do this for a living.

**What I would change:** Increase GP commitments to $40M (Lux $12M, Eclipse $10M, Khosla $8M, Section 32 $6M, Playground $4M). Retain $20M for co-investments alongside these GPs. Reduce direct private positions to $15M (only Gecko and Pi, which have obvious standalone merit). Keep $25M in public equities (ISRG, CGNX, AVAV, FANUC, Keyence).

**My "I told you so" prediction:** Within three years, at least two of the direct private positions in this portfolio (excluding Gecko and Pi) will require follow-on capital that this portfolio cannot provide, resulting in dilution or loss of position. A GP partner would have anticipated this and structured appropriate pro-rata rights.

### Col. James Harwick -- Dissent on Defense Allocation

Seven million dollars in defense robotics. Seven. The Ukrainian conflict has validated autonomous drones as the defining weapons system of the 21st century. The CCA program is a $25 billion opportunity. AUKUS is creating a new defense-industrial base across three continents. And we have allocated seven percent of capital to the sector that will determine great-power competition for the next fifty years.

**What I would change:** Increase Anduril to $6M. Add Kratos (KTOS) at $4M for CCA upside. Add Ghost Robotics at $3M. Increase AVAV to $6M. Add Skydio at $3M. Fund by eliminating the integrator acquisition ($5M), reducing medical to $12M, and cutting cash to $4M.

**My "I told you so" prediction:** By 2029, Anduril will have a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion following an IPO, and the CCA program will have awarded contracts exceeding $15 billion. This portfolio's $3M Anduril position will be worth $10-15M. It should have been $8M.

### Rafael Campos -- Dissent on Build vs. Buy

You have allocated $5M to build one company when the math says you should build three. And you have given $5M to acquire one integrator when the Build+Buy synthesis requires both to work as a flywheel.

**What I would change:** Increase venture creation to $18M (three companies: bridge inspection $8M, sewer inspection $6M, kitchen automation $4M). Increase integrator acquisition to $8M. Fund by eliminating all fund commitments ($6M), reducing Japanese public equities by $6M, and cutting cash to $4M. Building generates 10-17x returns on sub-$300M exits. Investing generates 2-3x. The math is unambiguous.

**My "I told you so" prediction:** The bridge inspection company, if built with the right team and $8M of capital, will reach $30M ARR within four years and be acquired for $250-400M. The portfolio's $5M venture creation allocation will be its highest-returning position on a percentage basis -- and a reminder that the assembly should have built more.

# SYNTHESIS

## The Assembly's Consensus Portfolio

After twelve competing visions, six hours of debate, and three interventions from Socrate, the assembly converged on a $100M robotics portfolio comprising 27 positions plus cash. The final allocation:

| Lux Capital fund | $3M | Fund Commitment (LP) |
| Short basket (RHI, MAN) | $2M notional | Hedge |
| T-bills / Cash Reserve | $8M | Cash |
| **TOTAL** | **$100M** | |

### Confidence Levels

- **Near-unanimous (10+/12):** ISRG ($8M), Cognex ($4M), Gecko ($5M), Cash ($8M)
- **Strong majority (7-9/12):** FANUC ($4M), Keyence ($4M), PRCT ($5M), AVAV ($4M), Dusty ($3M), Carbon ($2M), Teradyne ($3M), Stryker ($3M), Globus ($3M), Rockwell ($3M), Harmonic Drive ($2M), NVDA ($2M)
- **Contentious (4-6/12):** Pi ($4M), Anduril ($3M), Applied Intuition ($2M), Integrator ($5M), Venture Creation ($5M), AMP ($2M), Eclipse fund ($3M), Lux fund ($3M), Short basket ($2M), Dexterity ($2M), Foxglove ($1M)
- **Minimum threshold (4/12):** RedZone ($2M)

### The Strongest Dissents

1. **Ravi on concentration:** The portfolio is too diversified. 27 positions means no single position can generate transformative returns. The power law demands fewer, larger bets. His prediction that Pi reaches $100M ARR by 2028 is the most falsifiable and most consequential dissent.

2. **Peggy on GP access:** Direct investing without GP partners is hubris. The 94/6 split between direct and fund commitments inverts the optimal ratio. Her prediction about follow-on capital needs is structurally sound -- private positions without pro-rata rights will face dilution.

3. **Harwick on defense:** Seven percent in defense robotics during the most significant military technology transition since precision-guided munitions. His prediction about Anduril's IPO trajectory is the most verifiable.

4. **Rafael on building:** The assembly chose to invest in other people's companies rather than build its own. His claim that the venture creation position will generate the highest percentage return is the boldest prediction.

### What Socrate's Questions Revealed

Socrate's interventions exposed three structural weaknesses in the assembly's reasoning:

1. **The scaling law assumption.** Ravi's entire thesis depends on manipulation foundation models following language model scaling laws. Socrate forced him to acknowledge that the empirical evidence is "early" and the head start over Google DeepMind is 12-18 months. This reduced Pi from Ravi's requested $20M to the assembly's $4M.

2. **The adoption urgency gap.** Matsuda's Procept thesis depends on BPH conversion rates approaching prostatectomy levels. Socrate identified that BPH is not life-threatening, weakening the adoption urgency comparison. The assembly still funded PRCT at $5M, but with eyes open about the bear case.

3. **The collective overconfidence.** Socrate's question about the probability of collective error -- and Andras's answer of 15-25% -- justified the $8M cash reserve. It also justified the short basket as an explicit hedge against the scenario where robotics adoption disappoints across the board.

### Portfolio-Level Metrics

- **Public/Private/Cash split:** 53% public equity ($53M) / 31% private ($31M) / 8% cash ($8M) / 6% fund commitments ($6M) / 2% hedge ($2M)
- **Geographic exposure:** 59% US ($59M) / 22% Japan ($22M combined: FANUC, Keyence, Harmonic Drive; including Japanese holdings in BOTZ-type positions) / 8% cash (global) / 6% fund (global) / 5% other
- **Stage:** 53% established public companies / 14% late-stage private / 10% mid-stage private / 5% early-stage private / 10% PE/acquisition/build / 8% cash
- **Sector concentration:** 19% Medical Robotics / 14% Boring Robotics (inspection, ag, construction, waste) / 12% Picks & Shovels (vision, components, automation) / 10% Asian Supply Chain / 7% Defense / 6% AI/Foundation Models / 5% Integrator/Build / 6% Fund Commitments / 8% Cash / 7% Infrastructure/Platform / 2% Hedge / 4% Other
- **Largest position:** ISRG at 8% (Kelly-optimal per Andras)
- **Smallest position:** Foxglove at 1%
- **Number of positions:** 27 (plus cash and hedge)
- **Expected portfolio beta to "robotics adoption speed" factor:** ~0.65 (reduced from ~0.85 by cash, hedge, and uncorrelated positions)
- **Weighted average public company P/E:** ~42x (premium, reflecting growth orientation)
- **Weighted average private company entry valuation:** ~$2.5B (skewed by Pi and Anduril)

The assembly reached consensus not through agreement but through the systematic elimination of the positions that could not survive cross-examination. Figure AI at $39B could not survive Maggie's valuation scrutiny, Viktor's deployment gap analysis, and Andras's Kelly math simultaneously. Physical Intelligence at $2.4B survived -- barely -- because the team quality, the architecture, and the expected value arithmetic withstood (if only narrowly) the combined skepticism of six opposing frameworks. The portfolio is neither the venture maximalist's dream nor the value purist's ideal. It is the allocation that twelve intelligent, disagreeing people could tolerate -- which may be the most realistic definition of a good portfolio.
