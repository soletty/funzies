# $100M Robotics Investment Plan
## Final Deliverable -- Assembly of Twelve Frameworks
### February 16, 2026

---

# PORTFOLIO SUMMARY

This is a $100M allocation across 28 positions plus cash and hedges, designed for a 7-10 year horizon. Positions are sized using Kelly criterion where parameter estimation is feasible and capped at 8% of portfolio to limit concentration risk.

> **Key Assumptions and Risks**
>
> Before reading this plan, the reader should understand three structural assumptions that affect every position:
>
> 1. **Deal access is assumed but not guaranteed for private positions.** The plan allocates $26M to private companies and $6M to fund commitments. A $100M allocator does not automatically receive allocation in oversubscribed rounds, competitive secondary markets, or top-tier fund commitments. Failure to access any individual private position is a realistic outcome, and fallback deployment options are noted where applicable.
> 2. **Operational infrastructure costs are not included in the $100M.** Managing 28 positions across public equity, private direct, acquisitions, fund commitments, short selling, and company building requires a dedicated team. Budget $2-3M separately for a 3-year operational runway covering a portfolio manager, deal sourcer, analyst, and legal counsel. This cost is outside the $100M investment capital.
> 3. **Private position timelines are estimates.** Secondary share sourcing, direct investment closings, and acquisition processes routinely take 6-12 months. The phased deployment timeline reflects target dates, not guaranteed dates.

The portfolio optimizes for expected value, not comfort. It is concentrated in companies that have crossed the deployment gap (99%+ operational reliability), with a disciplined allocation to high-variance positions where the asymmetric upside justifies the risk. Every dollar is assigned to a named entity.

## 2. Position Details by Theme

### THEME A: MEDICAL ROBOTICS ($19M)

#### Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- $8,000,000
- **Ticker:** NASDAQ: ISRG
- **Current price:** ~$486 | Market cap: ~$172.5B
- **Allocation:** $8,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** ISRG is the best business model in robotics. 9,300+ installed da Vinci systems generate 70% recurring revenue from instruments, accessories, and services -- approximately $5.8B in recurring revenue alone. The da Vinci 5, cleared by FDA in March 2024, introduces force feedback and cloud connectivity, extending the technology lead for another product cycle. FY2025 revenue reached ~$10.06B, up 20.5% from FY2024's $8.35B. Over 14 million procedures have been performed. This is not a bet on the future of robotics. It is ownership of the present.
- **Entry criteria:** Accumulate below $450 on any 15%+ correction from current levels. The da Vinci 5 transition will create capital placement headwinds as hospitals defer purchases to wait for the new system. This creates a 10-20% pullback window consistent with historical generational transitions (2017 competitive scare, 2020 COVID, 2022 rate shock). At $420, you pay ~55-60x forward earnings for a 20% grower with 67% gross margins and 70% recurring revenue.
- **Risk factors:** 70-75x trailing P/E is aggressive even for this quality. Growth deceleration from 20% to 8-10% by 2030 would compress the multiple to 35-40x. Increasing competition from Medtronic Hugo (pending FDA), J&J Ottava (expected 2026-27), and CMR Versius (not yet FDA-cleared in US). Chinese domestic competitors are emerging.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if procedure growth falls below 8% for two consecutive quarters without an identifiable temporary cause. Sell if a competitor achieves FDA clearance with demonstrated clinical superiority in a major procedure category. Reduce position by 30% if the stock reaches $700 (implying $250B+ market cap and 80x+ forward earnings).
- **Assembly support:** Near-unanimous (11/12). Only Ravi excluded ISRG, arguing the expected value at $172B is inferior to Pi at $2.4B.
- **Time horizon:** 7-10 years. ISRG compounds. Base case: $24-32M by 2035 (3-4x).

#### Procept BioRobotics (PRCT) -- $5,000,000
- **Ticker:** NASDAQ: PRCT
- **Current price:** ~$27.79 | Market cap: ~$1.55B
- **Allocation:** $5,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** Procept at 400 installed Hydros systems with FDA clearance, Level 1 clinical evidence (WATER/WATER II), and a per-procedure consumable model is Intuitive Surgical circa 2005 at a $1.55B market cap. FY2024 revenue was $224.5M; TTM revenue has accelerated to ~$299.9M. BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) affects 12M men in the US. The conversion rate from TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) to aquablation (Hydros's thermal water-jet procedure) in hospitals with installed systems is approaching 40%. CMS reimbursement codes are established and per-procedure payment exceeds TURP reimbursement -- hospitals make more money with the Hydros system.
- **Entry criteria:** Accumulate below $30. Current price of ~$28 is near the target. The stock has pulled back significantly from $80+ highs, creating value. Buy on any further weakness below $25.
- **Risk factors:** Still unprofitable; relies on continued capital raises. Single-product company risk. BPH is not cancer -- adoption urgency is lower than prostatectomy, and conversion rates may plateau at 25-30% rather than following the da Vinci curve to 80%. If conversion plateaus, Procept reaches ~2,000 systems and $1.5B revenue -- still a 5x from $1.55B market cap, but the timeline extends.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if quarterly procedure growth falls below 15% for three consecutive quarters. Sell if a competing robotic BPH platform receives FDA clearance with superior clinical data. Reduce by 50% at $80 (4x from current entry).
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (8/12). Matsuda, Maggie, Viktor, Andras, Tom, Peggy, Elaine, Priya.
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $15-25M (3-5x). Bull case: $40-50M (8-10x) if BPH conversion follows the prostatectomy curve.

#### Stryker (SYK) -- $3,000,000
- **Ticker:** NYSE: SYK
- **Current price:** ~$366 | Market cap: ~$138B
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** Mako has 2,800+ systems installed and 20%+ procedure growth. Stryker's diversified $25.1B TTM revenue base (MedSurg, Neurotechnology) buffers cyclicality that would devastate a pure-play. Expanding into spine robotics. At 35-40x earnings, the valuation is premium but warranted by execution quality and growth.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy below $370. Accumulate aggressively below $330.
- **Risk factors:** Premium large-cap MedTech valuation. Competition from Zimmer Biomet ROSA, Smith+Nephew CORI. Hospital capital budget constraints could slow Mako placements. Spine robotics entry is later than competitors.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if Mako procedure growth drops below 10%. Reduce at $500 (rebalance).
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (7/12). Correlation diversifier for the medical cluster.
- **Time horizon:** 5-10 years. Base case: $6-9M (2-3x).

#### Globus Medical (GMED) -- $3,000,000
- **Ticker:** NYSE: GMED
- **Current price:** ~$88 | Market cap: ~$11.8B
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** Post-NuVasive merger creates the #2 pure-play spine company with $2.5-2.6B combined revenue and 550+ ExcelsiusGPS robots installed. Vertically integrated (own robot + own implants) is a structural advantage vs. competitors who partner. Merger synergies still being realized. Founder-led (David Paul) with strong operational discipline.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy below $90. Current price is at target.
- **Risk factors:** Merger integration execution risk. Spine market is mature and competitive. Medtronic Mazor X Stealth is a formidable competitor. Surgeon switching costs create adoption barriers.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if merger synergies miss targets for two consecutive quarters. Sell if ExcelsiusGPS placements stall below 100/year.
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (7/12).
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $6-9M (2-3x).

### THEME B: JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX ($10M)

#### FANUC (6954.T) -- $4,000,000
- **Ticker:** TYO: 6954
- **Current price:** Market cap ~$40.4B
- **Allocation:** $4,000,000 in public equity (Tokyo)
- **Entry thesis:** Largest industrial robot installed base on earth -- over 1 million units. CNC controls with 65% global market share. $7B cash pile. "Robots making robots" philosophy produces industry-leading margins. Only 20% of revenue from Japan; this is a global business priced in yen. Yen weakness creates periodic entry points for dollar-based investors.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy at 20x P/E or below. Target yen weakness below 155 USD/JPY as an entry catalyst. Deploy over 6-12 months.
- **Risk factors:** Cyclical exposure to capex cycles (auto, electronics). China trade tension impact on 20-25% of revenue. ABB Robotics under SoftBank ownership could become more aggressive competitor. Humanoid disruption could shift market dynamics long-term.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if CNC market share drops below 55%. Reduce if the yen strengthens past 130 USD/JPY without a corresponding revenue increase.
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (8/12).
- **Time horizon:** 7-10 years. Base case: $8-12M (2-3x).

#### Keyence (6861.T) -- $4,000,000
- **Ticker:** TYO: 6861
- **Current price:** Market cap ~$91.9B
- **Allocation:** $4,000,000 in public equity (Tokyo)
- **Entry thesis:** 55% operating margins are the highest of any industrial company globally. Direct sales model with 8,000+ engineers is a moat no competitor has replicated in 40 years. Every industrial robot on earth needs sensors and machine vision. Revenue of ~$7B. Less than 25% from Japan -- this is a global franchise.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy during the next Japanese market correction. Target 30x P/E entry, which requires patience. A 15-20% correction from current levels is likely within 18 months based on historical patterns (yen-driven corrections occur every 3-4 years).
- **Risk factors:** Premium valuation (P/E historically 30-40x). Limited robotics exposure per se (sensors/vision, not robot arms). China revenue exposure ~20%. Growth deceleration as factory automation matures.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if operating margins drop below 45% for two consecutive years. Reduce at 45x P/E.
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (7/12). Maggie wanted $10M; Andras trimmed for correlation with FANUC.
- **Time horizon:** 7-10 years. Base case: $12-20M (3-5x).

#### Harmonic Drive Systems (6324.T) -- $2,000,000
- **Ticker:** TYO: 6324
- **Current price:** Market cap ~$2.39B | Revenue ~$380M TTM
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 in public equity (Tokyo)
- **Entry thesis:** 60-70% global market share in strain wave gears -- the critical bottleneck component for every robot joint. Each humanoid robot requires 10-20+ harmonic gears versus 3-6 for a typical industrial robot. If humanoid production scales to 100,000 units annually, Harmonic Drive's revenue doubles at minimum. At $2.39B market cap, you are buying a near-monopoly on the most critical robotics component at a reasonable price.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy at current levels. Accumulate on any 15%+ pullback.
- **Risk factors:** Revenue cyclicality tied to robot shipments. Chinese competitors (Leaderdrive, Green Harmonic) gaining share at 40-60% lower price points. Patent on original harmonic drive technology has expired. Nabtesco's cycloidal gears are substitutes for some applications.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if Chinese competitor market share exceeds 25% in strain wave gears. Sell if a major humanoid company (Figure, Tesla) announces an in-house gear solution.
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (7/12).
- **Time horizon:** 5-8 years. Base case: $4-6M (2-3x). Bull case: $8-12M (4-6x) if humanoid production scales.

### THEME C: DEFENSE ROBOTICS ($7M)

#### AeroVironment (AVAV) -- $4,000,000
- **Ticker:** NASDAQ: AVAV
- **Current price:** ~$244 | Market cap: ~$12.1B
- **Allocation:** $4,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** The only pure-play public defense robotics company with combat-proven products. Switchblade 300/600 loitering munitions are extensively used in Ukraine -- the most important real-world validation in defense robotics. Puma is the most widely deployed small UAS in the US military. TTM revenue ~$1.37B, growing ~80% YoY, reflecting accelerating defense procurement. At $12.1B market cap, the valuation is richer than a typical defense contractor but reflects the only pure-play public defense robotics platform. JUMP 20 competing for FTUAS (Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System) program. International sales growing via NATO and Indo-Pacific allies. AUKUS (Australia-UK-US security pact) framework creates 2-3x revenue multiplier.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy at current levels. AVAV is already well-positioned; the risk of waiting is missing the defense procurement acceleration.
- **Risk factors:** Revenue concentration in DoD; budget sequestration would impact. Switchblade faces competition from cheaper international alternatives. JUMP 20 must win FTUAS. At $12.1B market cap, the stock is richly valued relative to defense sector peers -- a growth disappointment would compress the multiple significantly.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if JUMP 20 loses FTUAS with no viable follow-on program. Reduce by 30% if defense appropriations fail to increase for two consecutive fiscal years.
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (9/12).
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $8-12M (2-3x).

#### Anduril Industries -- $3,000,000
- **Status:** Private, ~$30.5B valuation (June 2025 round) | Revenue est. $1-1.5B
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 in secondary shares
- **Entry thesis:** Lattice OS is being woven into DoD command and control across every service branch: Army TITAN, USSOCOM Ghost drones, CBP Sentry Towers, USAF CCA (Collaborative Combat Aircraft) with Fury, Navy Dive-LD. This is not one program -- it is a portfolio of programs creating platform lock-in. Switching costs are measured in years and congressional authorization cycles. The AUKUS framework and NATO allied procurement create international expansion.
- **Entry criteria:** Secondary shares at $28-32B effective valuation (0-10% discount to last primary). Anduril is one of the most sought-after secondary names in the market; realistic secondary pricing is at or near the last primary valuation. If secondary is not available within 6 months, reduce position to $1.5M at next primary round valuation. **Note:** $3M is a small block for secondary brokers sourcing Anduril shares -- be prepared for minimum block sizes of $5M+ on platforms like Forge or Nasdaq Private Market, which may require partnering with other buyers.
- **Risk factors:** $30.5B on ~$1-1.5B revenue is extremely rich. Government contracting is lumpy and politically sensitive. Scaling hardware manufacturing is challenging. IPO timeline uncertain. Multiple hardware programs (Ghost, Altius, Anvil, Fury, Dive-LD) create execution risk across too many fronts simultaneously.
- **Exit criteria:** Hold through IPO. Sell 50% at IPO if valuation exceeds $80B. Exit entirely if Lattice is displaced from 2+ programs of record.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (6/12). Harwick wanted $8M. Andras capped the defense cluster.
- **Time horizon:** 3-5 years to IPO. Base case: $6-10M (2-3x). Bull case: $15-20M (5-7x) if Lattice achieves broad program-of-record adoption.

### THEME D: BORING ROBOTICS ($14M)

#### Gecko Robotics -- $5,000,000
- **Status:** Private, $1.25B valuation | Revenue est. $50-100M+
- **Allocation:** $5,000,000 in secondary shares or Series D+ direct
- **Entry thesis:** Gecko's climbing robots inspect industrial infrastructure at 99.4% defect detection rates -- deployment-grade in a narrow, valuable domain. Cantilever platform (AI + robotics) creates data-driven switching costs. Customer list reads like a defense-industrial roll call: US Navy, US Air Force, ADNOC Gas ($30M+ contract), NAES Corp ($100M+ multi-year deal), Georgia Pacific, Siemens, Mitsubishi. At $1.25B on $50-100M+ revenue, the valuation is reasonable for a company with defense contracts and blue-chip industrial customers.
- **Entry criteria:** Direct at current valuation or secondary at $1-1.25B. Do not pay above $1.5B.
- **Risk factors:** Climbing robots work on flat surfaces (storage tanks, ship hulls). Scaling to complex geometries (bridges with riveted joints, refineries with pipe mazes) requires solving different locomotion problems. Government contract dependency. Potential acquisition by L3Harris, General Dynamics, or Palantir at 2-3x (good but not the 5-10x target).
- **Exit criteria:** Hold through IPO or strategic acquisition. Sell if valuation exceeds $5B without corresponding revenue growth to $250M+. Exit if defect detection rates fall below 95% in new geometric domains.
- **Assembly support:** Near-unanimous (11/12). The strongest private company consensus.
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $10-15M (2-3x). Bull case: $25-40M (5-8x) if Cantilever platform achieves broad adoption.

#### Dusty Robotics -- $3,000,000
- **Status:** Private, est. $200-400M valuation | Funding: $55M+
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 direct, Series C
- **Entry thesis:** FieldPrinter autonomously prints BIM (Building Information Modeling) layout on construction floors at 1/16-inch accuracy. One person can lay out 10,000-15,000 square feet daily. Replaces 2-3 person layout crews and eliminates rework from measurement errors. Customer list: Turner Construction, Skanska, DPR, JE Dunn. The data center construction boom is an immediate and massive catalyst.
- **Entry criteria:** Direct at $200-400M valuation. The current valuation is attractive for a deployment-grade product with blue-chip customers.
- **Risk factors:** Single-function robot (layout only). Competition from total stations with robotic capabilities. Construction industry slow to adopt technology. Interest rate sensitivity on building starts.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if data center construction spending declines 20%+ from peak. Sell if a major construction tool company (Hilti, Trimble) launches a competing product at lower cost. Hold through acquisition (Hilti acquired Canvas for drywall finishing; Dusty is a logical next target).
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (8/12).
- **Time horizon:** 4-6 years. Base case: $9-15M (3-5x). Likely exit via acquisition by construction tools company.

#### Carbon Robotics -- $2,000,000
- **Status:** Private, est. $300-500M | Funding: $157M+
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 direct, Series D+
- **Entry thesis:** LaserWeeder kills 200,000 weeds per hour with 30 lasers. No chemicals. No herbicide resistance. Clear farmer ROI: eliminates herbicide cost and reduces labor. $70M Series D in October 2024 validates continued investor interest. AutoTractor adds autonomous operation capability.
- **Entry criteria:** Direct at $300-500M valuation.
- **Risk factors:** High unit cost (~$1M+) limits addressable market to large specialty crop operations (30,000-50,000 US farms). Seasonal revenue concentration. AutoTractor is pre-deployment and adds significant technical risk. Competition from chemical herbicides on price.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if autonomous tractor certification faces regulatory delays beyond 2029. Reduce if unit cost does not decline below $500K within 3 years.
- **Assembly support:** Majority (7/12). Viktor confirmed LaserWeeder as deployment-grade but flagged AutoTractor risk.
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $4-8M (2-4x).

#### AMP Robotics/Sortation -- $2,000,000
- **Status:** Private, est. $500M-$1B | Funding: $200M+
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 direct
- **Entry thesis:** 100+ recycling facility deployments with AI-powered sorting. Recognizes 80 billion objects annually with 90%+ recovery rates. 20-year $100M+ partnership with SPSA in Virginia -- the largest recycling automation project in the US. EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) mandates and municipal recycling targets create regulatory tailwinds that guarantee growing demand. The waste management market is $60B in the US alone.
- **Entry criteria:** Direct at $500M-$1B.
- **Risk factors:** Municipal contract cycles are slow. Competition from TOMRA (which acquired ZenRobotics). Facility capex requirements. Brand pivot to "AMP Sortation" suggests strategic uncertainty.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if EPR mandate expansion stalls in key US states. Reduce if TOMRA's AI sorting catches up to AMP's recognition rates.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (6/12).
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $4-8M (2-4x).

#### RedZone Robotics -- $2,000,000
- **Status:** Private, est. sub-$100M valuation
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 direct or acquisition
- **Entry thesis:** 100 million feet of pipe inspected. NASSCO (National Association of Sewer Service Companies)-certified Integrity platform. 44 countries. Thousands of municipal customers. Municipalities are legally required to inspect sewer infrastructure. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) is pouring billions into water and sewer infrastructure. At sub-$100M valuation, RedZone is priced as a niche industrial services company. It should be priced as a data-and-robotics platform for critical infrastructure.
- **Entry criteria:** Direct investment or outright acquisition at sub-$100M valuation. At this price, the downside is protected by the existing customer base and recurring software revenue.
- **Risk factors:** Municipal sales cycles are slow and budget-constrained. No Wall Street analyst coverage. Illiquid -- if you need to exit, you are calling three potential buyers. Management quality and financial transparency must be verified through diligence.
- **Exit criteria:** Hold indefinitely or exit via acquisition by Xylem, Veolia, or an infrastructure services roll-up. Sell if IIJA-funded municipal inspection budgets are materially cut.
- **Assembly support:** Minimum threshold (4/12). Harlan and Tom champion this; others worry about illiquidity.
- **Time horizon:** 5-10 years. Base case: $4-8M (2-4x).

### THEME E: AI / FOUNDATION MODELS ($6M)

#### Physical Intelligence (Pi) -- $4,000,000
- **Status:** Private, $2.4B valuation | Funding: $470M
- **Allocation:** $4,000,000 in secondary shares or Series B co-invest
- **Entry thesis:** The strongest founding team in robot learning globally: Karol Hausman (ex-Google Brain), Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley, foundational RL), Chelsea Finn (Stanford, meta-learning), Brian Ichter (ex-DeepMind). Pi-0 foundation model was released open-source February 2025 and is the closest thing to a GPT moment for physical AI. The architecture -- a VLA (vision-language-action) model controlling diverse robot embodiments -- is the correct technical approach. Open-source strategy creates a data flywheel: every lab fine-tuning pi-0 generates training data that flows back. At $2.4B, if Pi's model becomes the standard AI layer for 10% of global robot deployments by 2033, the company is worth $50-100B.
- **Entry criteria:** Secondary shares at $1.8-2.4B effective valuation. Do not pay above $3B. **Note:** At $4M, this is a small check relative to Pi's $400M+ rounds. Access is competitive and not guaranteed. The Lux Capital LP commitment (Position #18) is the primary pathway to co-invest access. If secondary shares cannot be sourced within 9 months, deploy $2M into the Lux fund commitment (increasing to $5M) and hold $2M in cash reserve.
- **Risk factors:** Pre-revenue; commercial deployment timeline uncertain. Pi-0 achieves ~85% success rate on novel manipulation tasks in controlled lab settings; commercial deployment requires 99%+. That gap has historically taken decades in robotics. The scaling hypothesis (that manipulation follows language model scaling laws) is unproven for physical systems. Google DeepMind's Gemini Robotics with 1,000+ researchers and unlimited compute could close Pi's 12-18 month head start. Open-source model means the architecture is replicable. Key person risk on founding team.
- **Exit criteria:** **24-month falsification trigger:** If pi-0 derivatives do not achieve 95%+ reliability on a defined set of 10 commercial manipulation tasks by Q1 2028, exit the position entirely. Sell if two or more founders depart. Reduce by 50% if Google DeepMind releases an open-source VLA model that matches or exceeds pi-0 performance.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (6/12 support, 6/12 oppose). The widest disagreement in the entire assembly. Andras's Kelly criterion sizes this at $3-5M; the $4M allocation is Kelly-appropriate.
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case if scaling hypothesis correct: $40-80M (10-20x). Base case if wrong: $0-4M (0-1x). Expected value at 20% success probability: $8-16M.

#### Applied Intuition -- $2,000,000
- **Status:** Private, $15B valuation | Revenue est. $300-500M ARR (annual recurring revenue)
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 in secondary or co-invest via Lux
- **Entry thesis:** The most commercially successful simulation company in autonomy. 18 of top 20 automakers as customers. Hundreds of petabytes of data processed. Core business is AV simulation, but expanding to mining, construction, agriculture, defense, and general robotics. If Applied Intuition captures manipulation simulation -- which they are building toward -- this becomes the training environment for every robot. At $15B, the valuation is high but backed by real revenue and customer traction.
- **Entry criteria:** Co-invest alongside Lux Capital at GP terms is the primary pathway -- $2M is too small for a direct investment at $15B valuation. Secondary at $12-15B is the fallback.
- **Risk factors:** $15B requires continued rapid growth. Core AV market has consolidated. Robotics expansion is not yet proven. Competition from NVIDIA Omniverse in simulation.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if ARR growth drops below 20%. Reduce if NVIDIA Omniverse achieves parity in robotics simulation quality.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (6/12). Both infrastructure realists and platform maximalists converged.
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $4-6M (2-3x).

### THEME F: PICKS AND SHOVELS / INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION ($12M)

#### Cognex (CGNX) -- $4,000,000
- **Ticker:** NASDAQ: CGNX
- **Current price:** Market cap ~$9.7B | Revenue $994M
- **Allocation:** $4,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** Undisputed machine vision leader for 25 years. $994M revenue growing 8.7% with AI-enabled capabilities driving an upgrade cycle. Every robot that needs to "see" uses Cognex or competes with Cognex. Strong Q4 2025 (revenue +10%, adjusted EBITDA +22.7%). Amazon is the largest customer. Recovery in manufacturing capex ahead.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy below $60. Accumulate aggressively below $50 (P/E compression to 60x on temporary manufacturing weakness).
- **Risk factors:** 86.5x P/E is aggressive. Cyclical with manufacturing capex. Amazon concentration risk. Competition from Keyence in machine vision.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if AI-enabled vision competitors (from Chinese companies) erode Cognex's pricing power measurably. Reduce at 100x P/E.
- **Assembly support:** Near-unanimous (11/12).
- **Time horizon:** 7-10 years. Base case: $8-12M (2-3x).

#### Teradyne (TER) -- $3,000,000
- **Ticker:** NASDAQ: TER
- **Current price:** ~$314.66 | Market cap: ~$49.3B
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** Owns Universal Robots (~$300M revenue, cobot market leader with ~50% share) and MiR mobile robots (~$100M revenue). The UR arm is what most integrator customers deploy daily. At $49.3B market cap for the full company (which includes semiconductor test equipment), the robotics division is a smaller fraction of total value than at lower market caps -- but UR and MiR remain the best pure-play cobot assets available in public markets.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy on a 20%+ correction from current levels (i.e., $280-300 range). At $315, the stock is fully valued; patience is required. A semiconductor cycle downturn would create the entry window without impairing the robotics division's fundamentals.
- **Risk factors:** Conglomerate discount -- you are paying for semiconductor test equipment to get robotics. Cobot (collaborative robot) competition intensifying (FANUC CRX, Doosan, ABB). UR market share may erode from ~50% as the market matures.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if UR market share drops below 35%. Sell if Teradyne spins off the robotics division (and reenter the spin-off directly).
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (7/12).
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $6-9M (2-3x).

#### Rockwell Automation (ROK) -- $3,000,000
- **Ticker:** NYSE: ROK
- **Current price:** ~$394 | Market cap: ~$44.3B
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** Largest pure-play industrial automation company in North America. The $1.37B Clearpath/OTTO Motors acquisition demonstrates strategic commitment to autonomous mobile robotics. Reshoring is a structural tailwind. Connected enterprise platform creates recurring revenue.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy on a 15%+ correction from current levels (i.e., $350-370 range). At $394, the stock is above our ideal entry. Manufacturing capex cycles create regular 15-20% drawdowns -- patience is warranted.
- **Risk factors:** Cyclical with manufacturing capex. Integration risk on Clearpath/OTTO. Competition from Siemens, Emerson, ABB.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if OTTO AMR (autonomous mobile robot) deployments fail to grow 30%+ annually for two years. Reduce if manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) stays below 50 for 12+ months.
- **Assembly support:** Strong majority (7/12).
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $6-9M (2-3x).

#### NVIDIA (NVDA) -- $2,000,000
- **Ticker:** NASDAQ: NVDA
- **Current price:** Market cap ~$4.44T
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 in public equity
- **Entry thesis:** Platform tax on the entire robotics ecosystem. Isaac Sim, GR00T, Cosmos, Omniverse, and Jetson constitute the most comprehensive robotics platform stack in existence. Every company in this portfolio uses NVIDIA hardware. However, robotics is <1% of NVIDIA's revenue, so this is a liquidity anchor and broad AI infrastructure bet, not a pure robotics position.
- **Entry criteria:** Buy at current levels. Small position acknowledging the efficiency problem Socrate identified: NVIDIA's robotics revenue could double and the stock would not move.
- **Risk factors:** $4.44T market cap means robotics is a rounding error. Data center capex cycle could reverse. Export controls create geopolitical complexity. This is not a robotics investment in any meaningful sense -- it is insurance.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if robotics-specific GPU revenue does not reach $5B by 2030. This is a monitoring position.
- **Assembly support:** Majority (7/12). Socrate correctly identified that $4M in NVIDIA is not a robotics investment. Position trimmed accordingly.
- **Time horizon:** Indefinite. Liquidity anchor.

### THEME G: BUILD AND ACQUIRE ($13M)

#### Integrator Platform Acquisition -- $8,000,000
- **Status:** Target TBD | Acquisition vehicle
- **Allocation:** $8,000,000 for controlling stake
- **Entry thesis:** The robotics integrator market contains hundreds of small-to-midsize revenue companies with 50-200 employees, 10%+ EBITDA margins, and founder succession problems. Target profile: FANUC or Yaskawa Authorized System Integrator in the US Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin), specializing in welding, palletizing, or machine tending. Recurring service revenue of 15%+ of total. Target smaller integrators with $10-20M revenue to match the $8M budget. At 8-12x EBITDA on $1-2M of earnings, enterprise value is $8-24M. $8M buys a controlling stake with seller financing on the remainder. The broader M&A market for integrators has moved to 8-12x EBITDA as PE firms compete for bolt-on acquisitions (up from 6-8x in 2020-2022).
- **Specific targets in the market:** MESH Automation (Michigan), Applied Manufacturing Technologies (Michigan), Motion Controls Robotics (Ohio), Midwest Engineered Systems (Wisconsin). The FANUC ASI network surfaces these deals. Acieta's PE acquisition in 2024 and ONExia's acquisition by Doosan for $25.9M confirm the market is active.
- **Entry criteria:** Close within 9 months. Diligence screens: no single customer >15% of revenue, management bench beyond founder, 6-12 months backlog, 15%+ service revenue.
- **Risk factors:** Single-acquisition concentration risk. Key-person departure when founder retires. Technology shift (AI-driven deployment) could make traditional integrators obsolete. Labor-dependent business: revenue scales with engineering headcount, and robotics engineers are scarce.
- **Exit criteria:** Exit via strategic acquisition at 10-15x EBITDA in years 5-7. JR Automation precedent: acquired by Hitachi at $1.43B on $600M revenue. If revenue grows from $15M to $30-40M with margin improvement from 12% to 16% EBITDA, that is $4.8-6.4M EBITDA at 10x = $48-64M EV. On $8M invested, that is a 6-8x MOIC. Conditional $3M bolt-on unlocked at month 18 if EBITDA targets are met (funded from cash reserve).
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (6/12). Tom and Rafael champion; Peggy prefers GP access; Ravi considers it capital misallocation.
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $24-40M (3-5x MOIC).

#### Venture Creation: Bridge Inspection Robotics -- $5,000,000
- **Status:** New company to be built | Retain 45% equity
- **Allocation:** $5,000,000 to build from scratch
- **Entry thesis:** 617,000 US bridges in the US, 45% over 50 years old. FHWA mandates biennial inspection at $5,000-30,000 per bridge. TAM (total addressable market): $3-5B annually in the US alone. Drone/crawler system with AI damage detection trained on FHWA's public database of 2M+ bridge inspection images. BOM (bill of materials): $12K for drone platform components. 8-person engineering team for 12 months to build the software stack. Revenue projections are conservative given government procurement reality: Year 2: $0-500K (initial pilot deployments with 3-5 DOTs). Year 3: $2-5M (expansion to 10-15 DOT contracts). Year 5: $15-25M ARR.
- **Entry criteria:** Recruit a co-founder with DOT procurement relationships within 6 months. If this deadline is missed, redirect $3M to Gecko Robotics (increasing that position to $8M) and $2M to RedZone Robotics (increasing to $4M).
- **Risk factors:** Key-person risk on the founder/builder. Gecko Robotics at $1.25B is already doing adjacent work with a 5-year head start. Government procurement cycles typically take 2-3 years from first contact to first PO for novel technology -- this is the binding constraint on revenue timing. Building hardware is harder than investing. Rafael's model assumes founder quality that may not be available.
- **Exit criteria:** At 45% ownership and a 10x revenue acquisition by an infrastructure services firm (Jacobs, AECOM, or Gecko itself), $5M becomes $135M on a $300M exit. Even a modest $100M exit returns $45M (9x). Sell at any acquisition above $200M. Shut down and write off if the company fails to reach $2M ARR by year 4.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (5/12). Rafael and Tom champion. Six-month co-founder recruitment deadline was a negotiated hard constraint.
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $25-60M (5-12x) on a $100-300M exit with 45% ownership. Downside: $0 (100% loss). Expected value at 50% success: $12-30M.

---

### THEME H: INFRASTRUCTURE AND PLATFORM ($3M)

#### Dexterity -- $2,000,000
- **Status:** Private, ~$500M valuation | Funding: $140M+
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 direct
- **Entry thesis:** Real customers (FedEx, GXO, Sumitomo, Sagawa Express). Production-focused manipulation for truck loading/unloading, palletizing, parcel singulation. Physical AI Agents with Arbiter orchestrator to prevent AI hallucinations. Simulation-backed ROI estimation. This is a company that has crossed the deployment gap in a narrow, valuable domain -- warehouse manipulation.
- **Entry criteria:** Direct at $500M.
- **Risk factors:** Competition from Amazon Robotics (which acquired Covariant's team). Warehouse automation is becoming commoditized. Manipulator arms face competition from AMR/ASRS (autonomous mobile robot / automated storage and retrieval system) approaches that avoid manipulation entirely.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if FedEx or GXO discontinue deployments. Sell at acquisition by logistics company.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (5/12).
- **Time horizon:** 4-6 years. Base case: $4-8M (2-4x).

#### Foxglove -- $1,000,000
- **Status:** Private, est. $100-200M | Funding: $30M+
- **Allocation:** $1,000,000 Series A/B
- **Entry thesis:** "Datadog for robotics" -- observability infrastructure for robot data. Every robotics team needs visualization, data management, and debugging. Supports 20+ customizable panels and multiple data formats (MCAP, Protobuf, ROS, ULog). The open-source MCAP format creates ecosystem lock-in. At $100-200M valuation, this is a genuine infrastructure pick at early-stage pricing where a 20-50x return is realistic.
- **Entry criteria:** Direct at $100-200M.
- **Risk factors:** Small company with modest funding. Market is fragmented. Competition from AWS IoT, Freedom Robotics. MCAP standard adoption could stall.
- **Exit criteria:** Sell if MCAP format fails to achieve >30% adoption among commercial robotics teams by 2028. Hold through acquisition (likely acquirer: Datadog, NVIDIA, or a major cloud provider).
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (5/12).
- **Time horizon:** 5-7 years. Base case: $5-20M (5-20x). High variance position sized accordingly.

---

### THEME I: FUND COMMITMENTS ($6M)

#### Eclipse Capital -- $3,000,000
- **Status:** $2.5B fund | LP commitment
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 LP commitment
- **Entry thesis:** Eclipse manages $2.5B with a thesis built around transforming physical industries. Partners from Applied Materials understand manufacturing-stage investing. Portfolio includes VulcanForms, Cerebras, and other advanced manufacturing companies. The $3M commitment provides co-investment rights and deal flow access in industrial robotics -- the exact categories where the portfolio has conviction (boring robotics, integrators, industrial automation).
- **Entry criteria:** Commit to current or next vintage fund.
- **Risk factors:** $3M in a $2.5B fund provides minimal LP influence (0.12% of fund). Management fees of ~$60K/year consume capital before returns. Fund timeline is 10 years. No control over specific company selection. **Note on LP minimums:** $3M may be below Eclipse's typical LP minimum ($5-25M for institutional-quality funds of this size). If rejected at $3M, pursue emerging manager funds focused on industrial robotics with lower minimums ($1-3M), or negotiate a co-invest-only arrangement that provides deal flow access without a full LP commitment.
- **Exit criteria:** Hold through fund lifecycle. Exercise co-investment rights when Eclipse identifies companies matching the boring robotics thesis.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (5/12). Peggy wanted $12M; Harlan conceded $2-3M.
- **Time horizon:** 10-year fund lifecycle. Base case: $6-12M (2-4x) net of fees.

#### Lux Capital -- $3,000,000
- **Status:** $5B+ fund | LP commitment
- **Allocation:** $3,000,000 LP commitment
- **Entry thesis:** Lux has the deepest defense tech and frontier technology network. Incubated Anduril. Invested in Applied Intuition. Defense networks and technical diligence capabilities that this portfolio cannot replicate in-house. The $3M commitment provides co-investment access alongside Lux in defense robotics deals.
- **Entry criteria:** Commit to current vintage fund.
- **Risk factors:** Same scale limitations as Eclipse. Lux's portfolio is broad deep tech -- robotics is only a portion. **Note on LP minimums:** Same constraint applies -- $3M may be below Lux's typical minimum. Same fallback strategy: pursue emerging manager deep tech funds or negotiate co-invest-only arrangements.
- **Exit criteria:** Hold through fund lifecycle. Co-invest alongside Lux in defense robotics opportunities.
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (5/12).
- **Time horizon:** 10-year fund lifecycle. Base case: $6-12M (2-4x) net of fees.

---

### THEME J: HEDGES AND CASH ($10M)

#### Short Basket: Robert Half (RHI), ManpowerGroup (MAN) -- $2,000,000 notional
- **Tickers:** NYSE: RHI, NYSE: MAN
- **Allocation:** $2,000,000 notional short
- **Entry thesis:** Staffing companies exposed to manufacturing labor are inversely correlated with the robotics adoption thesis. If robots replace human workers in manufacturing, warehousing, and services, staffing company revenue declines. This paired hedge reduces portfolio variance by ~30% while preserving expected return on the core robotics thesis.
- **Entry criteria:** Initiate short positions immediately. Split evenly: $1M notional RHI, $1M notional MAN.
- **Risk factors:** Short positions have unlimited theoretical loss. Staffing companies could rally on a services boom unrelated to automation. Borrowing costs and margin requirements create carrying costs.
- **Exit criteria:** Cover shorts if either company announces a strategic pivot toward robotics staffing/training that makes them correlated (rather than inversely correlated) with the robotics thesis. Cover if combined loss exceeds $800K (40% of notional).
- **Assembly support:** Contentious (5/12). Andras wanted $4M; Maggie and Tom opposed shorting.
- **Time horizon:** 3-5 years. The hedge is structural, not tactical.

#### T-bills / Cash Reserve -- $8,000,000
- **Allocation:** $8,000,000 in short-term T-bills
- **Entry thesis:** Andras's argument that 15-25% probability of collective overestimation implies 15-25% cash allocation. The $8M reserve serves three purposes: (1) dry powder for opportunistic entry into Tier 1 names on 20%+ corrections, (2) follow-on capital for the integrator bolt-on acquisition at month 18, (3) hedge against the scenario where the entire assembly is wrong about the pace of robotics adoption.
- **Deployment rules:** Deploy only when a near-unanimous position (ISRG, Cognex, Gecko, AVAV) falls 20%+ from intrinsic value. Maximum $3M per opportunistic deployment. Reserve $3M for integrator bolt-on at month 18 conditional on EBITDA targets. Maintain minimum $2M undeployed at all times.
- **Assembly support:** Near-unanimous (10/12). Only Ravi and Harwick wanted less cash.

## 3. Portfolio Construction Notes

### Public/Private Split
- **Public equity:** $45M (45%) -- Provides liquidity, transparency, and auditable financials
- **Private direct:** $26M (26%) -- Provides asymmetric upside and information advantage in undercovered markets
- **PE/acquisition/build:** $13M (13%) -- Provides control premium and operational alpha
- **Fund commitments:** $6M (6%) -- Provides GP access and co-investment rights
- **Hedges:** $2M (2%) -- Reduces portfolio-level correlation
- **Cash:** $8M (8%) -- Provides optionality and collective error hedge
- **Rationale:** The 45% public allocation ensures nearly half the portfolio can be liquidated within 5 business days. The 26% private allocation is the minimum required to capture the asymmetric returns available in boring robotics and AI foundation models. The 13% in acquisitions/builds reflects the increased integrator budget needed for realistic deal pricing.

### Private Market Execution Note
Secondary shares in private companies (Gecko, Pi, Anduril, Applied Intuition) are sourced through platforms such as Forge Global, EquityZen, and Nasdaq Private Market, as well as through direct broker relationships and existing investor networks. Typical minimum transaction sizes on these platforms are $100K-$500K for less sought-after names, but $2M-$5M+ for high-demand names (Anduril, Pi). All secondary transactions are subject to company right of first refusal (ROFR), board approval, and transfer restrictions that can add 30-90 days to closing. The Lux Capital LP commitment (Position #18) is a deliberate strategy to access co-investment deal flow that would otherwise be unavailable to a $100M allocator.

### Geographic Exposure
- **United States:** $80M (80%) -- All US-domiciled public equities, all private positions, integrator acquisition, venture creation, fund commitments, and short basket
- **Japan:** $10M (10%) -- FANUC $4M, Keyence $4M, Harmonic Drive $2M
- **Cash:** $10M (10%) -- T-bills $8M, short basket $2M (overlap with US; counted here for liquidity purposes)
- **Note on Asian underweight:** The assembly debated but could not resolve the China portfolio construction problem. Estun (A-shares, QFII required), Inovance, UBTECH, and Rainbow Robotics were considered but not included in the final allocation due to access constraints, governance concerns, and US-China capital flow restrictions. Asian exposure comes indirectly through FANUC, Keyence, and Harmonic Drive's Asian revenue bases (20-30% each from China).

### Correlation Analysis
- **Medical cluster:** ISRG + PRCT + SYK + GMED = $19M. These four positions are 0.6-0.7 correlated with each other and move together on FDA/reimbursement events. The cluster is the portfolio's largest correlated exposure.
- **Industrial cluster:** FANUC + Keyence + Cognex + Rockwell + Teradyne + Harmonic Drive = $20M. Correlated at 0.5-0.65 with manufacturing capex cycles.
- **Defense cluster:** AVAV + Anduril = $7M. Correlated at 0.7+ with US defense spending.
- **Boring robotics cluster:** Gecko + Dusty + Carbon + AMP + RedZone = $14M. Correlated at 0.4-0.5 with US capex but partially hedged by regulatory mandates (inspection requirements, EPR mandates).
- **AI/foundation model cluster:** Pi + Applied Intuition + NVIDIA + Dexterity + Foxglove = $11M. Correlated at 0.5-0.7 with AI sentiment/funding cycles.
- **Uncorrelated positions:** Integrator acquisition ($8M), venture creation ($5M), fund commitments ($6M), cash ($8M), short basket ($2M) = $29M. These positions are structurally uncorrelated with public equity sentiment.
- **Portfolio-level beta to "robotics adoption speed":** ~0.65 (reduced from ~0.85 by cash, hedges, and uncorrelated positions).

### Liquidity Profile
- **Immediately liquid (1-5 days):** $45M public equity + $8M cash = $53M
- **Moderately liquid (30-90 days):** $2M shorts (cover)
- **Illiquid (6-24 months):** $26M private positions (secondary market dependent)
- **Very illiquid (2-7 years):** $13M acquisition/build + $6M fund commitments
- **Net:** 53% of the portfolio is liquid within a week. 45% requires 6 months to 7 years to exit. 2% is actively short.

### Maximum Drawdown Scenario
If the 3 worst positions go to zero:
- **Worst case private positions:** Venture creation ($5M) + Pi ($4M) + Foxglove ($1M) = $10M total loss
- **Portfolio impact:** 10% loss from private position wipeout. Remaining $90M portfolio (public equity + other private + cash) absorbs the loss. Public equity positions (ISRG, Cognex, FANUC, Keyence) provide floor value.
- **Stress test:** If the 5 worst positions go to zero (venture creation $5M + Pi $4M + Foxglove $1M + RedZone $2M + Dexterity $2M = $14M), portfolio retains $86M. Cash reserve ($8M) + short basket gains from recession ($1-2M) = $9-10M in defensive value. Effective floor: ~$76M (24% maximum drawdown on the full portfolio even in catastrophic scenario).

---

## 4. Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Immediate (Days 1-30) -- Deploy $35M
These positions are time-sensitive or already at target entry prices:
1. **ISRG** $8M -- Begin accumulating. Any dip below $450 is a buy.
2. **Cognex** $4M -- Buy below $60; current price may already be near target.
3. **AVAV** $4M -- Buy now. Defense procurement acceleration is underway.
4. **PRCT** $5M -- Buy below $30; currently at ~$28, in the target zone.
5. **Stryker** $3M -- Buy below $370.
6. **GMED** $3M -- Buy below $90; currently at $88.
7. **T-bills** $8M -- Park in short-term T-bills immediately.

### Phase 2: Near-term (Months 1-6) -- Deploy $22M
These require deal sourcing or entry price patience. **Note:** Private placements (Gecko, Anduril, Pi) realistically take 6-12 months to source, negotiate, and close due to secondary market sourcing, legal due diligence, KYC/AML, and transfer restrictions (ROFR, board approval). The timeline below reflects target initiation dates, not expected closing dates.
1. **Gecko Robotics** $5M -- Source secondary shares or negotiate direct at $1.25B.
2. **Anduril** $3M -- Source secondary shares at $28-32B range.
3. **Pi** $4M -- Source secondary shares at $1.8-2.4B.
4. **Teradyne** $3M -- Buy on 20%+ correction ($280-300 range).
5. **Rockwell** $3M -- Buy on 15%+ correction ($350-370 range).
6. **NVIDIA** $2M -- Buy at current levels.
7. **Short basket** $2M -- Initiate RHI and MAN shorts.

### Phase 3: Medium-term (Months 3-9) -- Deploy $21M
These require Japanese market timing or private deal closing:
1. **FANUC** $4M -- Buy during next yen-driven correction or at 20x P/E.
2. **Keyence** $4M -- Buy during Japanese market correction.
3. **Harmonic Drive** $2M -- Buy at current levels or on pullback.
4. **Dusty Robotics** $3M -- Close direct investment.
5. **Carbon Robotics** $2M -- Close direct investment.
6. **AMP Sortation** $2M -- Close direct investment.
7. **Applied Intuition** $2M -- Co-invest via Lux or secondary.
8. **Dexterity** $2M -- Close direct investment.

### Phase 4: Long-term (Months 6-12) -- Deploy $22M
These require extended deal sourcing, company building, or GP commitment cycles:
1. **Integrator acquisition** $8M -- Source, diligence, and close acquisition (6-12 month process for founder-owned industrial businesses).
2. **Venture creation** $5M -- Recruit co-founder (6-month deadline), then begin building.
3. **Eclipse Capital** $3M -- Commit to current or next vintage fund.
4. **Lux Capital** $3M -- Commit to current vintage fund.
5. **RedZone Robotics** $2M -- Close direct investment or acquisition.
6. **Foxglove** $1M -- Close direct investment.

### Phase 5: Conditional (Month 18+) -- Deploy from cash reserve
1. **Integrator bolt-on** $3M from cash -- Conditional on platform acquisition meeting EBITDA targets.
2. **Opportunistic public equity** up to $3M -- Deploy when near-unanimous positions fall 20%+.

### 90-Day Milestone: $35M deployed (Phase 1), $22M in active sourcing (Phase 2), $21M in pipeline.
### 180-Day Milestone: $57-78M deployed depending on deal closing pace.
### 12-Month Milestone: $92M deployed, $8M reserved (of which $3M conditionally allocated to bolt-on).

## 5. Monitoring Framework

### Key Metrics by Position

| Position | Primary Metric | Trigger for Action |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| ISRG | Quarterly procedure growth | Below 8% for 2 quarters: reduce |
| PRCT | Quarterly system placements + procedure volumes | Below 15% growth for 3 quarters: exit |
| Gecko | Contract backlog + defect detection rates in new domains | Detection below 95% in new geometry: flag |
| Pi | Manipulation success rate on commercial tasks | Below 95% by Q1 2028: exit entirely |
| AVAV | Revenue growth + FTUAS award | FTUAS loss without follow-on: reduce |
| Anduril | Program-of-record conversions | Lattice displaced from 2+ programs: exit |
| FANUC | CNC market share + robot order growth | CNC share below 55%: exit |
| Keyence | Operating margin | Below 45% for 2 years: exit |
| Harmonic Drive | Chinese competitor market share | Chinese share exceeds 25%: exit |
| Integrator | Monthly EBITDA vs. plan | Below 80% of plan for 6 months: restructure |
| Venture creation | Co-founder recruitment, then ARR milestones | No co-founder by month 6: redirect capital |

### Rebalancing Triggers
1. **Single position exceeds 12% of portfolio:** Trim to 10%. This prevents ISRG from becoming an outsized risk if it compounds faster than expected.
2. **Any correlated cluster exceeds 25% of portfolio:** Trim smallest position in the cluster.
3. **Realized correlation between public positions exceeds 0.70 over trailing 12 months:** Trim the smallest correlated position and reallocate to cash.
4. **Cash reserve falls below $2M:** Halt all new deployments until replenished.

### When to Add vs. Cut
- **Add to positions** when: A near-unanimous company (ISRG, Cognex, Gecko) falls 25%+ from entry due to market-wide selloff (not company-specific bad news). Fund additions from cash reserve.
- **Cut losses** when: A private company misses specific milestones listed above. Do not average down on private positions that are failing -- the information asymmetry works against you.

### Quarterly Review Checkpoints
- **Q1 review:** Decision: Continue or exit Pi based on 95% reliability trajectory. Decision: Approve or terminate integrator acquisition search if no LOI signed. Decision: Evaluate venture creation co-founder candidates -- if none identified, begin redirecting capital per fallback plan.
- **Q2 review:** Decision: Deploy or defer Japanese positions based on P/E and yen levels vs. targets. Decision: Approve or reject each private deal in pipeline based on updated valuation and access. Review Gecko contract pipeline for signs of revenue acceleration or deceleration.
- **Q3 review:** Decision: Trim or hold correlated clusters based on realized 12-month correlation data vs. 0.70 threshold. Decision: Assess defense budget trajectory -- if continuing resolution likely, reduce AVAV/Anduril exposure by 20%.
- **Q4 review:** Decision: Go/no-go on integrator bolt-on based on trailing 6-month EBITDA vs. plan. Decision: Mark private positions to estimated fair value and determine if any require follow-on capital or write-down. Annual rebalancing execution.

## 6. Minority Reports

### Dissent 1: Ravi Chandrasekaran -- "This Portfolio Is Too Diversified to Win"

**Prediction:** By December 2028, Physical Intelligence will have a commercial product generating $100M+ in annual recurring revenue. The portfolio's 4% exposure to Pi will be its single biggest regret.

**What he would change:**
- Increase Pi from $4M to $10M
- Add Figure AI at $5M (secondary at 20%+ discount to $39B)
- Add Apptronik at $3M
- Fund by eliminating FANUC ($4M to $0), Keyence ($4M to $0), and cash ($8M to $2M)

**Why the assembly rejected this:** The Kelly criterion sizes Pi at $3-5M given the parameter uncertainty. $10M is 2-3x Kelly-optimal. Figure at $39B with zero commercial revenue was voted down 9-3. The assembly chose quantitative discipline over narrative conviction.

**What the portfolio change would mean:** If Ravi is right, his changes add $50-150M in upside. If he is wrong (Pi stalls at 90% reliability, Figure fails to manufacture at scale), the changes destroy $15-20M. The expected value calculation depends entirely on the scaling hypothesis probability, which the assembly judged at ~20% and Ravi judges at ~50%.

### Dissent 2: Col. James Harwick -- "Seven Percent in Defense Is a Rounding Error"

**Prediction:** By 2029, Anduril will have a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion following an IPO, and the CCA program will have awarded contracts exceeding $15 billion.

**What he would change:**
- Increase Anduril from $3M to $6M
- Add Kratos (KTOS) at $4M for CCA binary upside
- Add Ghost Robotics at $3M
- Increase AVAV from $4M to $6M
- Add Skydio at $3M
- Fund by eliminating the integrator acquisition ($8M), reducing medical to $12M, and cutting cash to $4M

**Why the assembly rejected this:** Andras's correlation analysis showed all defense positions are 0.7+ correlated with US defense spending. A continuing resolution -- which has occurred in 7 of the last 10 years -- would cause simultaneous drawdowns across the entire defense cluster. The adjusted Kelly for the defense cluster is $8-10M, not $22M.

**What the portfolio change would mean:** If the defense thesis plays out as Harwick predicts (AUKUS acceleration, CCA award, Anduril IPO), his changes add $30-50M in upside. If defense budgets flatten or contract (sequestration 2.0), the concentration creates a $10-15M drawdown that the original portfolio avoids through diversification.

### Dissent 3: Rafael Campos -- "Building Beats Investing"

**Prediction:** The bridge inspection company, if built with the right team and $8M of capital, will reach $30M ARR within four years and be acquired for $250-400M. The portfolio's $5M venture creation allocation will be its highest-returning position on a percentage basis.

**What he would change:**
- Increase venture creation from $5M to $18M (three companies: bridge inspection $8M, sewer inspection $6M, kitchen automation $4M)
- Increase integrator acquisition from $8M to $12M
- Fund by eliminating all fund commitments ($6M), reducing Japanese public equities by $6M, and cutting cash to $4M

**Why the assembly rejected this:** Rafael's model requires a founder of his caliber -- someone who has built and sold three robotics companies. The venture creation model scales with founder quality, and there is exactly one of him. Key-person risk is extreme. The assembly funded one company instead of three, with a hard six-month co-founder recruitment deadline and a fallback to Gecko Robotics.

**What the portfolio change would mean:** If Rafael recruits three stellar co-founders and all three companies reach modest exits ($100-300M each), the changes add $100-200M in upside. If co-founders cannot be recruited or companies fail to achieve product-market fit, the changes destroy $10-18M. The expected value depends on the probability of recruiting three co-founders of sufficient quality within 12 months, which the assembly judges at 20-30%.

## Closing Statement

This portfolio allocates $100M across 28 named positions with the following characteristics: 45% in publicly traded companies with audited financials and decades of operating history, 26% in private companies that have crossed the deployment gap in narrow valuable domains, 13% in controlled acquisitions and company building where operator skill generates alpha, 6% in top-tier GP access, and 10% in hedges and cash that protect against the collective error every member of this assembly may be making.

The portfolio's base case over 7-10 years is $250-350M (2.5-3.5x gross). The bull case -- where Pi cracks general manipulation, the integrator platform scales, the bridge inspection company exits at $300M+, and boring robotics compounds quietly -- is $400-600M (4-6x). The bear case -- where robotics adoption disappoints broadly, private positions take markdowns, and the scaling hypothesis fails -- is $150-180M (1.5-1.8x), protected by the quality of the public equity core and the $8M cash reserve.

Every dollar is assigned. Every company is named. Every position has an entry thesis, an exit trigger, and an honest assessment of what kills it.
