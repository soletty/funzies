## $15M INTEGRATOR ACQUISITION STRATEGY

### Recommended Approach

**Target Profile:**
- Revenue: $15-50M
- EBITDA margin: 10%+
- Employees: 50-200
- Specialization: welding, palletizing, inspection, or machine tending
- OEM authorization: FANUC and/or Yaskawa preferred
- Geography: US Midwest or Southeast (near manufacturing customers)
- Recurring service revenue: 15%+ of total (higher = better)

**Expected Valuation:**
- Entry: 6-10x EBITDA ($15M revenue, 12% EBITDA = $1.8M EBITDA = $11-18M EV)
- Exit: 10-15x EBITDA (with growth, platform premium) within 3-5 years

### Recommended Deal Structure

| Component | Amount | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Platform acquisition #1 | $8-10M | $20-30M revenue integrator, strong OEM relationships |
| Bolt-on acquisition #2 | $3-5M | Complementary specialty (e.g., vision/inspection if #1 is welding) |
| Working capital / growth | $2-3M | Sales team expansion, new OEM authorizations |
| **Total** | **$15M** | Combined platform: $35-50M revenue |

### Key Diligence Points for Integrator Acquisitions

1. **Customer concentration** — No single customer >15% of revenue
2. **OEM relationships** — Authorized integrator status is critical moat
3. **Backlog visibility** — 6-12 months of contracted projects
4. **Key person risk** — Owner/founder engineers often critical
5. **Service revenue %** — Higher recurring = higher valuation
6. **Geographic reach** — Within driving distance of manufacturing clusters
7. **Technology IP** — Proprietary fixtures, software, simulation tools
8. **Employee retention** — Robotics engineers are scarce, turnover is costly
