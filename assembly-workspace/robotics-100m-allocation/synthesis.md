## 1. Convergence

### Ideas That Emerged in Every Iteration (Structure-Independent — Highest Confidence)

- **Humanoid robotics at current valuations is uninvestable.** (Confidence: **High**)
  - Agreed by: all 12 members across all 3 iterations, including Asha Patel (the strongest humanoid advocate), who conceded in Iteration 3 that "the risk-reward is wrong even if the thesis is right"
  - Evidence: $10B+ invested globally, <$500M commercial revenue industry-wide. Figure AI at $39B on minimal revenue. Unitree G1 at $16K vs. Agility Digit at $150K — a 10x cost gap suggesting the form factor is commoditizing before the premium players have monetized.
  - Why meaningful: This convergence is remarkable because it includes characters whose frameworks would naturally support humanoids (Asha's AI-first thesis, Priya's platform thesis, Wei-Lin's China thesis). When even the bull case advocates reject current pricing, the signal is strong.
  - Appeared in: Iteration 1 (Duel 1 and Duel 2 assembly reactions), Iteration 2 (universal across all 4 pods), Iteration 3 (explicit zero-allocation consensus in final round)

- **Regulatory moats are the most durable competitive advantage in robotics.** (Confidence: **High**)
  - Agreed by: Marcus Hadley, Sandra Kovac, Col. Hale, Dr. Rengifo, David Chen, Ingrid Norgaard (6 of 12 — those whose frameworks privilege durability)
  - Not contested by: any member in any iteration. Asha, Priya, and Wei-Lin simply argued other factors matter more, not that regulatory moats don't work.
  - Evidence: Intuitive Surgical at $172.5B market cap, 9,000 installed systems, $7B/yr recurring revenue, 67% gross margins. FDA 510(k) pathway: 3-7 years, $50-150M cost = competitor delay measured in years.
  - Why meaningful: This was the single least-contested position across all debate structures. Even characters with incompatible frameworks (Asha's AI-first, Priya's platform) acknowledged medical robotics as a valid allocation.

- **The integration/distribution bottleneck is underpriced and strategically critical.** (Confidence: **High**)
  - Agreed by: Felix Warburg, Sandra Kovac, David Chen, Marcus Hadley, Nadia Osei-Mensah (via the Build+Buy synthesis)
  - Reasoning: The hardest problem in robotics is not building robots but deploying them. Companies owning customer relationships and deployment infrastructure capture disproportionate value regardless of which technology paradigm wins.
  - Evidence: Sandra's Wisconsin integrator (bought 6x EBITDA, sold 14x, 4.5x return in 4 years). David's TCO breakdown (25% integration/deployment costs). Felix's observation that integrators are anti-fragile to technology shifts.
  - Appeared in: Iteration 1 (Duel 3 — Felix's breakthrough insight on distribution), Iteration 2 (Pod A and cross-examination), Iteration 3 (Sandra's and David's final allocations)

- **China's cost advantage is real and must be captured, but direct exposure carries unacceptable tail risk.** (Confidence: **High**)
  - Agreed by: effectively all 12, through progressive refinement across iterations
  - Evidence: Unitree G1 at $16K vs. Agility Digit at $150K (10x gap). Chinese cobots at $4,800 vs. European at $15K+ (3x gap). China installs 276K of 530K global industrial robots (>50%).
  - The resolution evolved across iterations: Iteration 1 surfaced Socrate's devastating point about negative correlation between Chinese technological success and geopolitical stability. Iteration 2 produced Ingrid's compromise (invest in Chinese adoption through foreign component suppliers). Iteration 3 saw Wei-Lin himself concede from 50% to 35% direct China. Final consensus: access Chinese growth through Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese proxies.
  - Why meaningful: This convergence was produced by the collision of genuinely incompatible frameworks (Wei-Lin's supply-side thesis vs. Col. Hale's sovereign risk thesis), making it a high-quality synthesis rather than lazy agreement.

- **Data and simulation infrastructure is the highest-conviction cross-framework allocation.** (Confidence: **High**)
  - Agreed by: Asha Patel, Priya Chandrasekaran, Felix Warburg, Elena Vasquez-Strom, David Chen (5 of 12 — spanning AI-first, platform, second-order, systematic, and operational frameworks)
  - Reasoning: Regardless of whether the binding constraint is intelligence (Asha), manufacturing (David), or platform (Priya), all paths require simulation, synthetic data, and training infrastructure.
  - This appeared independently in all three iterations without being prompted — a strong signal of robustness.

- **Cash reserves are essential — the best opportunities may not exist yet.** (Confidence: **High**)
  - Agreed by: 9 of 12 members in Iteration 3 held 10-25% explicit reserves
  - Reasoning: shared uncertainty about timing + current elevated valuations + the Bitter Lesson's applicability to robotics remaining empirically unresolved for 3-5 more years

### Convergences That Appeared in Two of Three Iterations (Moderately Robust)

- **"Boring robotics" as an investable category** (Confidence: **Medium-High**)
  - Emerged in Iterations 2 and 3. Not present in Iteration 1 (duels were too narrowly paired to surface it).
  - Sewer inspection, agricultural weeding, underground mining, waste management, infrastructure inspection — sectors with acute labor scarcity, high willingness-to-pay, and zero venture capital attention.
  - By Iteration 3's final round, 7 of 12 members incorporated boring robotics into allocations despite none mentioning it in opening statements. This is the strongest emergent idea of the entire process.

- **The Build+Buy synthesis** (Confidence: **Medium**)
  - Felix Warburg's Iteration 1 insight: Sandra's integrator portfolio provides distribution infrastructure for Nadia's studio companies. The combination is worth more than the sum.
  - Reinforced in Iteration 2 (Pod A cross-examination, "Anti-Portfolio as Portfolio" emergent idea).
  - Less prominent in Iteration 3, where individual strategies were presented independently. This may be structure-dependent — the duel format forced direct confrontation that produced the synthesis, while the Grande Table format allowed members to present in parallel.

- **Temporal sequencing of the allocation** (Confidence: **Medium**)
  - Years 1-3: deploy into operational/proven businesses (David, Sandra). Years 3-7: deploy into AI-first companies as the Bitter Lesson's applicability becomes empirically testable (Asha, Marcus's dry powder). Years 7-10: harvest or double down.
  - Appeared in Iterations 1 and 2 but was not explicitly structured in Iteration 3's final allocations (most members presented static portfolios).

## 2. Divergence

### The Four Irreducible Splits

- **Can individual winners be identified ex ante?**
  - Marcus Hadley (Concentration): Yes — moat analysis on observable properties (installed base, regulatory clearance, supply chain depth, service infrastructure) identifies winners. Intuitive Surgical was identifiable by 2010.
  - Elena Vasquez-Strom (Systematic): No — idiosyncratic risk is unforecastable. Survivorship bias infects all retrospective claims of stock-picking skill. Systematic exposure dominates.
  - What data both sides accept: Power-law return distributions in robotics. Historical data on venture fund performance.
  - Where interpretations fork: Whether the allocator has the skill to identify the fat tail ex ante, or whether that skill claim is unfalsifiable (Socrate's Iteration 1 point about Hadley's 1999 evidence being structurally an argument for diversification).
  - Why irreducible: This is an epistemological disagreement about the limits of human judgment in complex systems. It cannot be resolved by evidence because the evidence itself is subject to survivorship bias.

- **Does the Bitter Lesson transfer to physical robotics?**
  - Asha Patel (AI-first): Yes — scaling laws are universal. RT-2, RT-X, Physical Intelligence all show the curve.
  - David Chen (Operations): No — physical world reward ambiguity, safety criticality, and sim-to-real gap are fundamental barriers, not engineering problems.
  - Socrate's Iteration 1 intervention was the sharpest formulation: every example Sutton cites operates in a domain with a known reward function. What is the reward function for folding laundry or picking a strawberry?
  - Why irreducible: This is an empirical question that will be resolved within the 10-year horizon, but capital must be allocated before the answer is known. Asha provided a falsifiable claim: if by 2029 no foundation model achieves 90%+ success on novel manipulation tasks outside controlled environments, she's wrong. David provided his: if a foundation-model-powered robot achieves lower TCO than a purpose-built system in a 1,000+ unit deployment, he's wrong.

- **Geographic risk tolerance**
  - Wei-Lin Zhao: Taiwan contingency priced at <5% over 10 years (insurance markets, CDS spreads). Expected value favors Chinese exposure even with total-loss tail.
  - Col. Hale: Taiwan contingency is a central planning scenario, not a tail event. Total loss is binary and correlated with every other portfolio risk.
  - Socrate's devastating Iteration 1 point: Chinese technological success and geopolitical stability are negatively correlated. The downside scenarios are more likely precisely in the states where the portfolio is most valuable. Wei-Lin conceded he had not modeled the joint distribution.
  - Why irreducible: genuine difference in threat assessment operating on different intelligence bases and different priors.

- **Build vs. Buy vs. Benefit**
  - Nadia (Build): ownership economics dominate. 10x on $10M > 2x on $35M.
  - Sandra (Buy): cash flow certainty dominates. Compounding at 25% annually turns $100M into $900M.
  - Felix (Benefit): second-order asymmetry dominates. Benefits from robotics success without bearing development risk.
  - This is a conflict about the allocator's comparative advantage, not about robotics itself. Marcus's Iteration 3 observation — "the strategy and the strategist are not separable" — applies here directly.

## 3. Unexpected Alliances

- **Felix Warburg (Second-Order) + Sandra Kovac (PE Roll-Up):** Both independently converge on the insight that robotics service and maintenance businesses are anti-fragile to technology shifts. More complexity = more service revenue. Felix frames it theoretically (Bastiat's unseen effects); Sandra frames it operationally (recurring service revenue as valuation driver). Neither entered the debate expecting to agree. Their synthesis — acquire integrators as second-order beneficiaries of the entire robotics wave — is the most actionable emergent strategy.

- **Ingrid Norgaard (Labor Economics) + Wei-Lin Zhao (China):** Opposed on geography but perfectly aligned on the demand signal. China's working-age population peaked in 2015; Japan needs 700K care workers; California's ag labor halved in 8 years. Together they describe a trade with structural tailwinds on both sides: Chinese-manufactured robots deployed into labor-scarce markets. Neither alone reaches this synthesis.

- **Marcus Hadley (Concentration) + Dr. Rengifo (Regulatory Moat):** Hadley's conviction-based concentration + Rengifo's sector expertise = concentrated positions in medical robotics companies with regulatory moats. Hadley entered wanting to invest in "moated hardware companies" generically; Rengifo provided the specific sector where moats are deepest and most measurable.

- **Asha Patel (AI) + Dr. Rengifo (Medical):** The "triple moat" emergent idea from Iteration 2 — AI-augmented diagnostic robots with regulatory clearance + AI capability + clinical evidence. Neither member fully articulated this position alone, but their intersection produces the highest-conviction investment thesis that survived all three iterations.

---

## 4. Knowledge Gaps

The assembly cannot resolve the following without outside expertise or research:

- **Sim-to-real transfer rates under realistic conditions.** Asha cites lab results; David cites field failures. Neither has data on foundation model performance in unstructured environments over 10,000+ operational hours. This data does not yet exist and is the single most important empirical question for the portfolio.

- **Precise valuations for mid-market robotics integrators.** Sandra's thesis depends on acquiring integrators at 5-8x EBITDA. The assembly assumed these exist and are acquirable. No member provided a deal pipeline or verified that 3-5 targets at these multiples are currently available.

- **Joint probability distribution of Chinese technological success and geopolitical escalation.** Socrate identified this in Iteration 1 and Wei-Lin conceded he had not modeled it. No member has the geopolitical modeling expertise to estimate this correlation. It materially affects the China allocation.

- **Reimbursement trajectory for non-surgical medical robotics.** Rengifo's thesis extends beyond surgical robotics to orthopedic, rehabilitation, and diagnostic categories. The regulatory moat argument depends on reimbursement codes existing or opening. The current state of CMS reimbursement for robotic rehabilitation and AI-augmented diagnostics was not verified.

- **The "portfolio of allocators" structure.** Marcus's Iteration 3 insight — that the optimal allocation may be distributing capital to specialist allocators (Wei-Lin for China, Nadia for building, Tomas for medical) — was acknowledged but never formally structured. The governance, incentive, and coordination problems of this approach were not explored.

## 5. Confidence Levels

| Position | Confidence | Justification |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Zero allocation to humanoids at current valuations | **High** | Unanimous across 3 iterations, 12 members, including the strongest bull |
| Medical/regulated robotics as the most defensible segment | **High** | Least contested in all 3 structures; validated by Intuitive Surgical's $172.5B |
| Integration/distribution bottleneck is underpriced | **High** | Converged by 5+ members across incompatible frameworks; Sandra's empirical returns confirm |
| China cost advantage is real and structural | **High** | 10x cost gap is empirical fact; no member contested the data |
| Access China through international instruments, not direct exposure | **High** | Progressive convergence across all 3 iterations, including Wei-Lin's concession |
| Data/simulation infrastructure is high-conviction | **High** | Independent convergence across 5 frameworks in all iterations |
| "Boring robotics" deserves 5-10% allocation | **Medium-High** | Emergent in iterations 2 and 3; 7/12 adopted; but no member has deep expertise in these sectors |
| AI foundation models for manipulation will eventually dominate | **Medium** | Asha's thesis is theoretically compelling but empirically unproven; Socrate's reward-function question remains unanswered |
| PE roll-up of integrators returns 3-5x | **Medium** | Sandra's track record is real but sample size is 1 success, 2 failures (33% hit rate by her own admission) |
| Platform economics will emerge in robotics | **Low-Medium** | Priya's thesis was the most challenged; David's "name one robotics platform" was devastating; ROS and Priya's own company both failed commercially |
| Second-order effects manifest within 10 years | **Medium** | Felix's thesis is structurally sound but his AV real estate trade (5 years early) shows timing risk |
| Venture studio can systematically create 4-7 robotics winners | **Low-Medium** | Nadia's ownership math is correct but median studio returns underperform median venture; depends entirely on founder quality |

## 6. Emergent Ideas

Ideas that no single member entered with but emerged from framework collision. These are the highest-value outputs of the process.

- **The Build+Buy Distribution Flywheel.** (Iterations 1, 2) Felix Warburg observed that Sandra's integrator portfolio provides distribution for Nadia's studio companies. Acquire profitable integrators → use their customer relationships and deployment infrastructure → channel-deploy products built by the venture studio. Cash flows from acquisitions fund venture creation. Neither build nor buy alone; the combination captures both cash-flow certainty and upside optionality. This was the single most generative idea across all iterations.

- **"Boring Robotics" as an investment category.** (Iterations 2, 3) No member entered with sewer robots, waste management, or underground mining as a thesis. Ingrid's labor-scarcity framework naturally identified these sectors, David's operational lens validated them, and by Iteration 3, 7 of 12 had allocated to them. The logic: highest labor scarcity, highest willingness-to-pay, zero venture capital competition, zero glamour tax on valuations.

- **The Triple Moat: Regulatory + AI + Clinical Evidence.** (Iteration 2) Intersection of Rengifo's regulatory moat thesis and Asha's AI-first thesis. AI-augmented diagnostic robots (pathology, radiology, endoscopy) create three simultaneous barriers: FDA clearance, AI training data from clinical deployment, and published clinical outcomes. No single member proposed this; it emerged from pod cross-examination.

- **The Allocator-Dependence Problem.** (Iteration 3) Marcus Hadley's observation that "the strategy and the strategist are not separable" — that the optimal allocation depends on who is deploying the capital. This implies the meta-answer might be a "portfolio of allocators": distribute $100M to specialist managers ($15M to Wei-Lin for China, $15M to Nadia for building, $15M to Tomas for medical, etc.). This was the most philosophically important insight but the least operationally developed.

- **The Robotics Winter Hedge.** (Iterations 2, 3) Elena and Felix independently converged on the need to hedge against the shared bias of a room full of robotics believers. If the probability that all 12 members collectively overestimate robotics exceeds 10% — and Felix argued it exceeds 30% — then some allocation should explicitly hedge against this. Short overvalued SPACs, long labor-intensive businesses that benefit if automation disappoints, options structures on robotics indices.

- **Chinese-Supply-Into-Labor-Scarcity Trade.** (Iteration 2) Ingrid + Wei-Lin synthesis: Chinese-manufactured robots deployed into labor-scarce markets (Japanese eldercare, European agriculture, American construction). The supply side (China) sets the cost curve; the demand side (demographics) guarantees adoption. Structural tailwinds on both sides, accessed through international instruments to avoid geopolitical risk.

## 7. Concrete Recommendations

### The Meta-Portfolio: $100M Allocation

This allocation reflects arguments weighted by rigor, evidence quality, honesty of concessions, and cross-iteration robustness. It is designed for a generalist allocator with no specific geographic, operational, or technical edge.

| # | Category | Amount | Assembly Support | Key Risk | Who Predicted It |
|---|----------|--------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Medical/regulated robotics** — orthopedic, rehabilitation, AI-augmented diagnostics with existing or near-term FDA pathways | $20M | Near-unanimous | FDA timelines slip; reimbursement codes don't open | Rengifo, Hadley |
| 2 | **Industrial robotics integrator acquisitions** — 2-3 profitable businesses at 5-8x EBITDA, recurring service revenue, 40%+ gross margins. Apply Danaher playbook. | $18M | Majority (Sandra, David, Felix, Marcus) | AI disruption commoditizes integration; Fanuc/ABB vertically integrate | Sandra, David |
| 3 | **AI and foundation models for robotic manipulation** — 2-3 companies, NOT at humanoid mega-cap valuations. Focus on manipulation, logistics, single-vertical deployment. | $12M | Minority-but-strongly-argued (Asha, Priya) | Bitter Lesson doesn't transfer to physical world; sim-to-real gap is fundamental | Asha |
| 4 | **Data/simulation infrastructure** — simulation-to-real pipelines, synthetic data, teleoperation data collection | $10M | Near-unanimous | Infrastructure without killer apps; NVIDIA dominates and commoditizes | Asha, Priya, Felix |
| 5 | **Defense and sovereign robotics** — 1-2 companies on Anduril model, ITAR moats, contested logistics | $8M | Moderate (Hale, Hadley) | Defense budget cuts; procurement cycle too slow for 10-year horizon | Hale |
| 6 | **Labor-scarce verticals ("boring robotics")** — eldercare, agriculture, infrastructure inspection, sewer/mining/waste | $8M | Majority-emergent (7/12 by Iteration 3) | Deployment harder than expected in unstructured environments; immigration policy changes | Ingrid, David |
| 7 | **Asian supply chain exposure** — Japanese sensor makers, Korean/Taiwanese precision components selling into Chinese demand. NO direct China equity. | $7M | Near-unanimous compromise | Chinese demand slows; supply chain decouples | Wei-Lin (data), Ingrid/Elena (instrument) |
| 8 | **Second-order winners** — power infrastructure, robotic liability insurance, fleet cybersecurity | $7M | Moderate (Felix, Elena) | Timing — Felix's AV real estate trade was 5 years early | Felix |
| 9 | **Venture creation** — 1-2 companies in boring-robotics verticals, leveraging acquired integrators as distribution | $5M | Minority-but-argued (Nadia) | Studio model depends on exceptional founder; base rates are poor | Nadia |
| 10 | **Robotics winter hedge + cash reserve** | $5M | Moderate (Elena, Felix, 9/12 held reserves) | Opportunity cost if robotics bull case is correct | Elena, Felix |
| | **Total** | **$100M** | | | |

### Deployment Sequencing

**Years 1-2:** Deploy $50-55M
- Acquire 2-3 integrators ($18M)
- Take positions in medical robotics companies with existing FDA clearance ($15M)
- Initial data/simulation infrastructure positions ($7M)
- Asian supply chain positions ($5M)
- Begin scouting boring-robotics opportunities ($5M)
- Establish robotics winter hedge ($2M)

**Years 3-5:** Deploy $30-35M
- AI foundation model positions as empirical evidence emerges on Bitter Lesson transfer ($12M)
- Defense robotics positions ($8M)
- Second-order winners ($7M)
- Remaining medical robotics ($5M)
- Additional cash reserve deployment ($3M)

**Years 6-10:** Deploy remaining $10-15M + harvest
- Follow-on into top performers
- Venture creation leveraging acquired distribution
- Opportunistic reallocation based on which frameworks proved correct
- Begin exits from positions that have achieved target multiples

### What Could Go Wrong

| Scenario | Probability | Impact | Which Character Predicted It |
|----------|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| Humanoid companies at current valuations actually succeed and this portfolio misses the 50x | 10-15% | High opportunity cost on the right tail | Asha (thesis right, allocation wrong) |
| Chinese robotics dominates AND geopolitical stability holds — this portfolio's 7% Asia is far too low | 20-25% | Significant underperformance vs. direct China exposure | Wei-Lin |
| Robotics adoption takes 30 years, not 10 — portfolio is right on direction but wrong on timing | 15-25% | Most positions underperform; only integrators and second-order winners survive | Felix, Elena |
| AGI arrives by 2030 and reshapes entire competitive landscape | 10-20% | All current allocations are wrong; regulatory moats may be only survivors | Asha (named it), Marcus/Tomas (claimed moats survive) |
| Mid-market integrators are acquired by strategics before we can buy them | 15-20% | Sandra's thesis is correct but inaccessible at assumed valuations | Sandra (risk acknowledged) |
| Foundation models for manipulation achieve <90% success by 2029 | 30-40% | $12M AI allocation underperforms; David's operational thesis validated | David |

---

## 8. Honest Failures

### What the Assembly Cannot Resolve

**The Allocator Problem.** Marcus's Iteration 3 observation that the optimal allocation depends on who deploys it was acknowledged by the room and never resolved. This meta-portfolio is optimized for a generalist. Wei-Lin would do better with more China. Nadia would do better building companies. Tomas would do better in medical. A "portfolio of allocators" structure — distributing $100M to 5-7 specialist managers — may dominate this single-allocator approach, but the governance, incentive, and coordination problems were not explored.

**The AGI Wildcard.** Asha named it, nobody hedged it. If general AI capability advances faster than expected, the entire competitive landscape in robotics could be reshuffled. No member proposed a way to position for this scenario. Marcus and Tomas argued regulatory moats survive discontinuity, but this is assertion. The assembly chose not to price AGI risk because no one knows how to.

**The Timing Problem.** Felix's core concern — that "early" and "wrong" produce identical returns — applies to multiple positions in this portfolio. If robotics adoption is slower than all 12 members expect (and the history of robotics IS the history of adoption being slower than expected), even the "safe" positions in integrators and medical robotics will underperform plain Treasury bills. The 5% robotics-winter hedge is intellectually honest but may be inadequate if this shared bias is real.

**Sandra's Base Rate.** Sandra's PE roll-up thesis anchors a significant allocation ($18M). But her own track record is 1 success, 2 failures — a 33% hit rate. The assembly weighted her success (4.5x on the Wisconsin integrator) heavily and her failures lightly. This may be its own survivorship bias.

**The Platform Question.** Priya's thesis was the most contested and least resolved. David's challenge — "name one robotics platform that has achieved the dynamics you describe, in robotics, with physical robots" — was never adequately answered. The assembly allocated only $10M to simulation/data infrastructure (Priya's closest proxy) and near-zero to pure platform plays. If platform economics do emerge in robotics, this portfolio misses them entirely. The assembly's honest position: we don't know if robotics will have a platform layer, and we're not confident enough to bet large on it.

---

## Cross-Iteration Analysis: What the Structure Revealed

### Structure-Dependent Findings (appeared in only one iteration — treat with caution)

- **The "portfolio of allocators" concept** emerged only in Iteration 3 (Grande Table), where the open-floor format allowed Marcus to make a meta-observation about the entire exercise. The duel and triade formats, by forcing specific pairings, did not create the conditions for this insight. This is a genuine structure-dependent finding — valuable but needing validation beyond this process.

- **The specific 4-layer architecture** from Iteration 1 (Cash-Flowing Platform / Concentrated Conviction / Venture Creation / Strategic Optionality) was a product of the duel format, where each duel produced a clear winner/synthesis that mapped naturally to a portfolio layer. Iterations 2 and 3 produced different architectures, suggesting the 4-layer framing is an artifact of the paired structure.

### Where Iterations Contradicted

- **Venture creation allocation:** Iteration 1 suggested $20-30M for venture creation. Iteration 2 suggested $3-5M (reduced after Socrate's challenge about running 7 companies simultaneously). Iteration 3's meta-portfolio settled at $5M. The progressive reduction reflects the assembly's increasing skepticism of the studio model under cross-examination — a genuine learning curve, not structure-dependence.

- **China direct allocation:** Iteration 1 suggested leveraging Chinese supply chains through Western-domiciled companies. Iteration 2's Pod C debated 10-50% direct. Iteration 3 saw Wei-Lin concede from 50% to 35%. The meta-portfolio uses 7% through international instruments. The trajectory is clear: more examination = less direct China exposure. This convergence toward indirect exposure appears robust.

- **AI allocation sizing:** Iteration 1 suggested $10-20M "strategic optionality" including AI. Iteration 2 suggested $10-15M for AI-first robotics. Iteration 3's meta-portfolio settled at $12M. The consistency across structures (despite different framings) suggests this is a genuine equilibrium — large enough to capture discontinuous upside, small enough to survive if the Bitter Lesson doesn't transfer.

### What the Multi-Iteration Process Added

The most valuable insight from running three independent iterations: **the progressive sophistication of the China question.** Iteration 1 surfaced the tension (cost advantage vs. geopolitical risk) and Socrate's devastating point about negative correlation. Iteration 2 produced the compromise instrument (invest through international proxies). Iteration 3 saw the strongest China bull (Wei-Lin) voluntarily reduce his allocation. No single iteration would have produced this nuanced a resolution. The three-iteration structure earned its cost on this question alone.

The second-most valuable: **the emergence and validation of "boring robotics."** Absent from Iteration 1 (too narrow), emerged in Iteration 2 (cross-pod collision), and was adopted by 7/12 in Iteration 3 (validation by adoption). This is a textbook example of an idea that could not have been produced by any single perspective and required adversarial deliberation to surface.
