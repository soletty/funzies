## LAYER 1: INTELLECTUAL TRADITIONS

### Deep Tech Value Concentration — Marcus Hadley (SKEPTIC)
- **Warren Buffett** — *1991 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter*. The case against "diworsification": spreading capital thinly across too many positions reduces both returns and management attention. Marcus applies this directly to hardware investing where board involvement drives outcomes.
- **Peter Thiel** — *Zero to One* (2014), Ch. 5-7 on monopoly and power law. In venture, the best investment in a fund outperforms all others combined. In robotics, 2-3 companies will capture 80%+ of total value. Concentration is the rational response.
- **Charlie Munger** — *Poor Charlie's Almanack* (2005). "Sit on your ass investing" — the discipline to hold 3-4 positions for decades. Applied to robotics: patient capital in moated companies compounds.

### Founder-Operator Primacy — Nadia Osei-Mensah
- **Joseph Schumpeter** — *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy* (1942). The entrepreneur as agent of creative destruction. Value creation is an act of founding, not an act of investing.
- **Paul Graham** — "Do Things That Don't Scale" (2013). The first 18 months of a company — manual, unscalable work — is where competitive advantage is created.
- **Israel Kirzner** — *Competition and Entrepreneurship* (1973). Entrepreneurial alertness — seeing opportunities others miss — as fundamental economic driver.

### Operational Realism — David Chen (PRAGMATIST)
- **W. Edwards Deming** — *Out of the Crisis* (1982). Quality is a system property. Manufacturing excellence is the ultimate competitive advantage in hardware.
- **Taiichi Ohno** — *Toyota Production System* (1988). Continuous improvement and waste elimination applied to robotics manufacturing.
- **Rodney Brooks** — Writings on practical robotics. Simple, robust systems at scale beat complex demonstrations in labs.

### Thematic Macro Systematization — Elena Vasquez-Ström
- **Carlota Perez** — *Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital* (2002). Technology revolutions follow predictable installation-crash-deployment phases. Robotics is in late installation.
- **Ray Dalio** — *Principles* (2017). Bridgewater's "All Weather" approach applied to thematic investing. Capture structural shifts across asset classes.
- **Harry Markowitz** — *Portfolio Selection* (1952). Modern portfolio theory applied to thematic concentration vs. diversification.

### Shenzhen Convergence Theory — Wei-Lin Zhao
- **Clayton Christensen** — *The Innovator's Dilemma* (1997). Low-end disruption framework: Chinese robotics companies entering at low cost and moving up-market.
- **Kai-Fu Lee** — *AI Superpowers* (2018). China's advantage in deployment speed, engineering talent, data abundance.
- **Andrew Bunnie Huang** — *The Hardware Hacker* (2017). Inside view of Shenzhen ecosystem and rapid iteration culture.

### Embodied Intelligence Primacy — Asha Patel (CRAFT)
- **Rich Sutton** — "The Bitter Lesson" (2019). General methods leveraging computation beat specialized methods leveraging human knowledge. Directly applicable to robotics.
- **Andrej Karpathy** — Software 2.0 thesis. Neural networks as a new paradigm replacing hand-coded systems across all domains.
- **Varela, Thompson, Rosch** — *The Embodied Mind* (1991). Intelligence is fundamentally grounded in physical interaction.

### Demographic Materialist Economics — Ingrid Nørgaard (ACCESS)
- **Daron Acemoglu** — "The Wrong Kind of AI" and labor market research. Automation adoption driven by labor market conditions, not technology supply.
- **Claudia Goldin** — *The Race Between Education and Technology*. Long-run view of labor markets shaped by institutional and demographic forces.
- **Nicholas Eberstadt** — *Men Without Work*. Demographic analyses of East Asian labor crises driving robotics adoption.

### Sovereign Capital Theory — Col. Marcus Hale
- **Vannevar Bush** — *Science, the Endless Frontier* (1945). Government funding of basic research as engine of national prosperity.
- **William Perry** — Offset strategy memoirs. Technology transitions driven by defense investment create commercial spillovers.
- **Andrew Marshall** — Office of Net Assessment. "Competitive strategies" investing in technologies that impose disproportionate costs on adversaries.

### Industrial Compounding — Sandra Kovač (COMPOUNDER)
- **Henry Singleton** — Teledyne Corporation case study. Disciplined acquisition and capital allocation creating conglomerate value.
- **Danaher Corporation** — Danaher Business System. Acquire niche leaders, apply operational discipline, cross-sell. Built $200B company.
- **Bruce Greenwald** — *Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond*. Competitive advantages within established businesses.

### Platform Value Capture Theory — Priya Chandrasekaran
- **Parker, Van Alstyne, Choudary** — *Platform Revolution* (2016). Platform layer captures more value than all application layers combined.
- **Ben Thompson** — Aggregation Theory (Stratechery). Internet enables aggregators to capture demand and commoditize supply.
- **Steve Cousins** — Willow Garage and ROS. First attempt at robotics platform; vision correct, business model wrong.

### Regulatory Moat Capitalism — Dr. Tomás Rengifo
- **Clayton Christensen** — *The Innovator's Prescription* (2009). Disruptive innovation in healthcare constrained by regulation.
- **Michael Porter** — *Redefining Health Care* (with Teisberg). Value-based healthcare framework for evaluating medical robotics.
- **Atul Gawande** — *The Checklist Manifesto* (2009). Systems thinking in medicine; limits of human surgical performance.

### Second-Order Value Theory — Felix Warburg (PARADOX)
- **Frédéric Bastiat** — *That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen* (1850). Foundational text of second-order thinking in economics.
- **Nassim Taleb** — *Antifragile* (2012). Investments that benefit from volatility vs. those harmed by it. Infrastructure and insurance are antifragile.
- **Carlota Perez** — *Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital* (2002). Deployment phase rewards infrastructure, not pioneers.

### Cross-Reading Assignments
- Marcus Hadley must engage: Christensen's *Innovator's Dilemma* — his moat thesis assumes incumbents remain leaders, but disruption theory predicts they won't
- David Chen must engage: Sutton's "Bitter Lesson" — his operational realism may be the "hand-engineering" that scaling makes obsolete
- Asha Patel must engage: Deming's *Out of the Crisis* — her AI-first thesis ignores manufacturing quality as a competitive dimension
- Wei-Lin must engage: Perez's technology revolution framework — China's cost advantage may be an installation-phase phenomenon
- Sandra Kovač must engage: Parker's *Platform Revolution* — her roll-up targets could be commoditized by platform dynamics
- Priya must engage: Brooks's practical robotics writings — physical-world platforms may not follow software platform dynamics
